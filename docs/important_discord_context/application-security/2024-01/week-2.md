Eyerolles phd thesis https://theses.hal.science/tel-01623849/document has imo very good explainations (and obviously goes into way more details than the short papers)

This had the part that I was missing from Eyerolles' paper about the extended euclidean algorithm. Was able to successfully replicate the insertion of identities algorithm

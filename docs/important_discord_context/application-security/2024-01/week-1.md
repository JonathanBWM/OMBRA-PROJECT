[2024-01-03 23:36] snowua: Does anyone have any good MBA obfuscation resources that they could share. Im researching for the purposes of writing my own obfuscation. Preferably something with a lower entry barrier is preferred. I have not read research like this for fun so it's pretty difficult to digest especially with lacking linear algebra skills. Am I going to have to live with this and overcome the barrier by studying?

linear alg and discrete will be your best friends with that tbh, but you don’t *need* it for basic understanding ig. I’ll drop some papers here let me see if I can access em on phone

[2024-01-04 00:12] daax: I’m sure <@162611465130475520> and <@524684755287932951> have some really good ones as well

[2024-01-06 00:16] snowua: <@609487237331288074> did you find 👉 👈

I was on a flight and the person sitting next to me happened to be from the math department from my university haha

[2024-01-06 13:42] snowua: Helped me understand it

[2024-01-06 13:43] snowua: Blessed flight seating

[2024-01-06 14:33] sariaki: holy shit

Eyrolles, the OG

[2024-01-06 16:43] snowua: The paper unfortunately covers more simplification than obfuscation (as the title states)

[2024-01-06 17:10] contificate: has pseudocode for doing the obfuscation in it though

[2024-01-06 17:10] contificate: and good background

[2024-01-06 17:10] contificate: the original Zhou paper is a bit involved math wise

[2024-01-06 23:13] abu: Zhou!

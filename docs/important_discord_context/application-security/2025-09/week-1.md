🙏

[2025-09-02 15:19] chadsexgod: If you have to pick one one of those <@794594207624462366>, pick VMP.

[2025-09-02 15:20] chadsexgod: It is the most stable and functional.

[2025-09-02 15:20] chadsexgod: There are lots of open source projects though, which may be weaker, but are less known to the public and there is less tooling centered around them.

[2025-09-02 15:21] chadsexgod: there was codedefender.io too, but they just stopped selling for some reason.

[2025-09-02 15:36] dullard: Where are the CodeDefender people to shill ????

[2025-09-02 15:37] Brit: they presumably do not sell to p2c reets anymore

[2025-09-02 15:38] Brit: so no more advertisement spam

[2025-09-02 15:45] the horse: VMP is probably the most stable out of all of them

[2025-09-02 15:45] the horse: the architecture is well explored by many; so if you're concerned about that, but not concerned about performance, go with Themida (i wouldn't recommend this for programs with parallel processing)

[2025-09-02 15:45] the horse: realistically all the public tooling is half-assed or only supports old versions (for static purposes)

[2025-09-02 15:46] the horse: it is definitely not a replacement for an anti-tamper; it's best if you implement additional precautions yourself

[2025-09-02 15:46] the horse: most people will prioritize dynamic analysis in these situations regardless

[2025-09-02 16:00] Brit: very powerful

[2025-09-07 06:41] 2rax: anyone dm me if ur good at security and not leaving any traces

Very nice

- admitting fraud
- admitting to DoSing their server

[2025-08-02 11:16] roddux: please be more careful unless you want angry layers chasing you

[2025-08-02 11:42] varaa: god forbid a guy has a hobby

[2025-08-02 12:28] Tr1x: The law doesn't care about that, you sent the request with language in the blog that seems the intention is malicious not to mention they just committed fraud and said the company was selling stalkerware. If there isn't an active bug bounty program with a defined scope then they can 100% try you in court, if they win who knows. I don't give a shit about this company either way, just that the guy needs to watch out.

[2025-08-02 13:05] roddux: I’m just saying to be careful 🙂

[2025-08-02 13:05] roddux: Getting criminal charges for computer naughtiness can negatively impact career prospects in the field

I don’t fuck with bug programs I just try to hack what interests me

[2025-08-02 22:52] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: I found a bug in ACI learning and privately disclosed in the last month as well

[2025-08-02 22:52] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: But sometimes I don’t disclose

[2025-08-02 22:52] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: Because it’s just for fun

[2025-08-02 22:53] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: Nothing damaging nor malicious although technically could get me in trouble I tend not to worry

[2025-08-02 22:53] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: [replying to roddux: "Getting criminal charges for computer naughtiness ..."]
Have and has

[2025-08-02 22:54] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: That’s my house being raided

[2025-08-02 22:55] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: My discord open with my username visible.

[2025-08-02 22:57] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: I’m working on a state local dispensary and have found interesting bugs but I won’t make any of it public as I’ve learned my lesson on the companies I can do that to.

[2025-08-02 23:14] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: It’s just tempting not to

now that you mention it in a public chat and fbi already know who you are... I'd call that pretty public.

[2025-08-02 23:29] rin: [replying to PЩПΣПGIПΣ: ""]
these are funny, thanks for sharing

[2025-08-02 23:31] rin: But really it's better to not do anything questionable, plenty of things to do without messing up your life.

[2025-08-02 23:53] PЩПΣПGIПΣ: True

[2025-08-03 01:31] Tr1x: [replying to PЩПΣПGIПΣ: "I don’t fuck with bug programs I just try to hack ..."]
I only mentioned it to say that a company without a defined scope if they can will come after you but there is a world beyond bug bounty which allows you to do just that and still not end up in court over shitware and web exploitation.

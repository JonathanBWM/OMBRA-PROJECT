guests can benefit

[2025-01-27 20:52] contificate: even nowadays, people talk of cpuid handling for advertising normal CPU features

[2025-01-27 20:52] contificate: and in the more general case

[2025-01-27 20:53] contificate: a lot of guests running above a hypervisor know they're being virtualised

[2025-01-27 20:53] contificate: because it's more performant for them to know, i.e. to be paravirtualised

[2025-01-27 20:53] contificate: and have special drivers instead of being poorly emulated in slow ways by QEMU or something

for most things, the “new” windbg and their scripting engine is pretty useful

yeah I haven't played around much with that

[2025-10-28 21:51] Gestalt: wasn't fortunate enough

[2025-10-28 21:52] Gestalt: but yeah also like new windbg a bit more

[2025-10-28 21:52] Gestalt: but I liked the old's windowing "system"

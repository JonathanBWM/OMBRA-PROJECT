[2024-10-23 21:30] not-matthias: I'm writing my bachelor thesis on API-only tracing and there's the limitation that programs could insert noop function calls to hide the real ones. Has anyone ever seen this in real-life or on Github projects?

[2024-10-23 21:33] not-matthias: It's obviously a very specific bypass, cause all I've seen is ppl using direct syscalls

yeah, seen it as in implemented i suppose, but can't say i've seen it in any public github projects. could be wrong. dunno if you're asking about seeing itw or sthg though.

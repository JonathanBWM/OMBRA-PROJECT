some crimeware packers do this, but i think their intention is more anti-emulator than cluttering API tracing logs

[2024-10-29 22:31] vendor: there was an old packer from like 5 years ago that would redirect the payload’s entire IAT to remapped modules. for some functions like CreateFile they even redirected to syscall stubs and implemented a shitty translation layer to the Nt calls that was good enough for the malware of the day.

[2024-10-29 22:32] vendor: that packer also did some cool stuff with .net payloads, loaded and patched the CLR to make it more resistant to dumping

[2024-10-29 22:34] vendor: they got a bit of traction then disappeared. ppl who did malware research at this time will probably recognize who in talking about - they had a web builder interface on tor and the developer was an interesting guy…

[2024-10-29 22:55] hecker: This should not be teached on YouTube 😂

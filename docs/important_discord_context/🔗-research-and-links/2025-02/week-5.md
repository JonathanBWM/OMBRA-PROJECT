theres a similar open redirect to that

[2025-02-24 04:10] Deleted User: go to a youtube video

[2025-02-24 04:11] Deleted User: look in the description for a link, copy the link, and just change the link to whatever u want and it works as a open redirect because the redir token works regardless

[2025-02-24 04:11] Deleted User: same concept though just leveraging the fact that the redirect endpoint accepts an arbitrary URL through the q parameter

Ah sure, this copy-and-patch compilation yoke is grand for a quick fix like but it’s got its fair share of draw backs man. Them stencils they use? Deadly for speed, but if you want to tweak the setup, you’re a little stuck starting from scratch with a new batch. It's not going to complete with LLVM (ye probably know that already)  and the memory? ffs man that's a bit of an issue lol, register allocation’s a bit of a disaster aswell don't know much about the allocations they use but seem outdated general, makin’ any fancy optimizations a right pain in the arse. It’s fast, fair play to it, but it’s not the full shilling, if you catch me drift. but all in all I actually liked the article 🙂

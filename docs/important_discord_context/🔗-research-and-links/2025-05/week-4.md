[2025-05-20 12:03] hellohackers: I don't agree with Ivan's approach, but that's dishonest competition

[2025-05-20 12:03] hellohackers: If the product you market is truly superior, release a fully functional version for testing, just as others do

[2025-05-20 12:03] hellohackers: Let's see how long it lasts after running the test corpus

not really dishonest, its actually illegal to file fake dmca notices. BE Labs releasing an unpacker for malware is within reason i'de say.

is xyrem working for vmprotect now?

[2025-05-20 15:13] Xyrem: [replying to pinefin: "is xyrem working for vmprotect now?"]
no

[2025-05-20 15:14] pinefin: [replying to Xyrem: "no"]
oh well, hi xyrem its been a long ass time

However:
Ivan should provide support to those who need such a service. BE Labs is trying to promote its own product at the expense of breaking the terms of use of a competitor's product.

ye its actually a fair strike, but its a dick move from vmpsoft

Yes, I agree, he should provide support for malware cases.

[2025-05-20 15:15] hellohackers: Oreans too.

can you prove anything was decompiled, disassembled or reverse engineered to achieve unpacking?

[2025-05-20 16:39] Brit: also its not like some random TOS from russia is legally binding anyway

does america have legal sanctions currently with russia since theyre invading ukraine?

[2025-05-20 17:21] pinefin: im not on the vmp side, im just wondering

[2025-05-20 17:22] pinefin: cause if so, the dmca wouldnt be valid

[2025-05-20 19:17] subgraphisomorphism: Indeed

[2025-05-20 19:18] subgraphisomorphism: We forward all dmca requests we receive from Russian companies to <@775688014176452608>

Except it doesn't unpack

[2025-05-20 21:49] subgraphisomorphism: Unpacks the packed sections

[2025-05-20 21:49] subgraphisomorphism: Should I add an import fixer?

well you can't really reverse anything when it's just a dump <:Kappa:794707301436358686>

[2025-05-20 21:49] daax: fix iat, fix ep, we'll call it even.

same project as the dude posted above but you have to register to the website 🤡

and lifting to ir would be nice. 

speaking of that, im scared to contact you guys about BLARE since the last company i contacted about something they posted, quoted me 200k.

that price seems about right

[2025-05-21 00:28] UJ: as soon as i saw its written in rust, i knew i couldnt afford it.

[2025-05-21 00:54] hellohackers: Imagine offering a service for which you've only created a relocator (the rest of which is probably based on an open source project, without even giving due credit)

[2025-05-21 00:55] hellohackers: And still have the audacity to speak badly of others!

ZathuraDbg is an open-source GUI debugger for assembly. The primary goal of ZathuraDbg is to make the process of learning assembly easier with a clean UI.

What made you choose icicle?

[2025-05-22 02:06] daax: It also says the easiest to debug assembly, but I’m wondering how it’s easier than x64dbg for quick prototyping; what makes it easier?

[2025-05-22 02:08] daax: I think my biggest con of this is the use of icicle which notably handles lots of simd, bit manipulation instructions, “esoteric” / uncommon instructions incorrectly.

[2025-05-22 04:47] rc: [replying to 5pider: "amazing work mate <a:catkeyboardwarrior:1051377071..."]
thank you!

[2025-05-22 04:50] rc: [replying to daax: "What made you choose icicle?"]
I used unicorn in a previous version but it became a huge hassle to maintain. Simple things like a breakpoint needed to have a very complicated hook (for my use case). The hooks even have issues with things like infinite loops, PC being incorrect, memory management can get very slow, etc.

[2025-05-22 04:51] rc: It is also easier to deal with multiple architectures in icicle than it is to deal with in unicorn

Do you have any examples?

[2025-05-22 05:54] daax: [replying to rc: "Do you have any examples?"]
sure i’ll burn one for the sake of example:

```
lss rax, tword ptr [rbx]

[rbx] := {0x1122334455667788, 0x99AA};
```

this should fail, because the ss selector is invalid in that sequence which should #GP(selector) or #SS(selector), so the emulator didn’t bother to check selector is valid or that it was even present. the success of this given the offs+sel is incorrect.

it’s clear that there are no checks incorporated, just blind load+store. plenty more if you go through and validate under various trivial and complex conditions.

other examples: some instructions aren’t defined altogether, and they’ve been around for multiple common generations (i.e. not something specific to 12th gen+). another gimmick with instruction emu was `call rel16` wound up zext the upper bytes of the instruction pointer when emulating 32b binaries. there are numerous other small mistakes that make the emulation unreliable.

[2025-05-22 05:59] rc: Interesting. So it does have a lot of breaking points in the core emulation

[2025-05-22 05:59] daax: in short: icicle for the time being (their public content) is not fit for any extensive emulation imo. for a tool to help people learn assembly it needs to be accurate otherwise it’ll just confuse the user more. this is not to shit on your project ofc, but I would highly recommend either going through and validating the x86 spec for icicle yourself, or use something different. there is a single instruction I could put in this program and icicle would throw an Exception.MissingPCodeOp… it’s just not a great representation.

[2025-05-22 06:00] rc: Fair enough, I'll look into this. Thank you for the explanation 🙏

np, I like the idea of this tool btw. I think for beginners especially this would be nice. might even be useful to quickly find bugs in icicle and submit PRs (easy divergence testing against real execution), which would make it (icicle) more viable overall.

[2025-05-22 06:06] rc: Indeed. I'll try to do as much as possible to get icicle to improve by PRs.

[2025-05-22 06:07] rc: Also, are there any assemblers which are alternatives to keystone but have sections support? They have completely ripped it out which makes putting any code which has sections in the tool break

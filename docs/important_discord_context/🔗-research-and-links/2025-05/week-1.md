whats the hype behind getting the peb?

[2025-05-02 22:13] diversenok: To confuse malware detection you need to confuse yourself first

[2025-05-02 22:13] DirtySecreT: not to be a jerk or athg but i dont really understand. i feel like with apis there are dozens of ways and without it ur kind of limited to maybe a dozen methods unless u can use seh/veh

yeah, pretty much. I suppose it's just a fun exercise? it at least gets them familiar with the instruction set and thinking about alternative ways to do things

lol i just saw ur tweet and had seen mrexodias too quoting it. i feel like thats more fun than reading a blog about instructions in the manual u can use to do this since theres so few

[2025-05-02 22:18] DirtySecreT: maybe im being unnecessarily critical but i see these posts constantly. seems like more regularly now

[2025-05-03 12:11] the horse: every year or so these code golfs or alternative methods gain a little hype, then die down again

[2025-05-03 19:35] codeneverdies: [replying to DirtySecreT: "whats the hype behind getting the peb?"]
to be honest im still a noob so I thought the blog was interesting seeing how many different ways there are to get the peb

We are trolling, it’s highly regarded

[2025-05-03 19:58] mrexodia: The post was fine though, always good to be aware of alternative ways to do things!

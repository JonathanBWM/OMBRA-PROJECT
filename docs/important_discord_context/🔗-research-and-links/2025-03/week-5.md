Hacked together an IDA Pro MCP server in a few hours tonight\! I gave Claude a simple crackme, but forgot to remove the source code from my project folder and in the end it cheated to find the solutio

Success\! Claude 3\.7 with my IDA Pro MCP server managed to solve the crackme that was previously failing🦾

The trick was adding a convert\_number tool and stress to always use it for conversions\. It

Given all the Claude\+IDA MCP hype, I present to you the Anti\-Clida:

\.rept 200001
pushq %rax
addq $8, %rsp
\.endr

@mrexodia must be stopped\.

[2025-03-28 16:44] brew002: Finished this project awhile ago but I delayed releasing it because I intended to have an accompanying write-up for it. Unfortunately I was too busy to complete the write-up but I do intend to in the future. Anyways, here it is: https://github.com/brew02/CovertThread. Thought it might be interesting to some people here as it was initially inspired by the callout-poc project done by drew

[2025-03-28 16:50] Brit: neat I'll look over your imp, that was a fun project that the callout poc was carved out of

Why V8 decided to move away from Sea of Nodes and go back to CFG instead

Streamlined the installation process of my IDA Pro MCP server\. You can now start experimenting with vibe reversing in less than 2 minutes\!🤯

This was using Claude for testing, but Cline and Roo Code

[2025-03-11 03:07] k0ss: I'm trying to figure this one out.  When it says "given the old PDB file" is it talking about a PDB from an older version of the program?  So if you found a leaked PDB from way back maybe you could apply it to a new binary?

11 years after XP's end\-of\-life we have decided to completely stop supporting operating systems older than Windows 10\.

The project will slowly transition to Visual Studio 2022 and Qt 5\.15 with CM

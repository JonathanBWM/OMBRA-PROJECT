A new blog post on OS design principles, the purpose of BSOD, and challenges of driver dev

"On System Reliability and Why the (Conceptual) Design of the Blue Screen on Windows Is a Good Thing"

I can

nice read. last week i had to explain the same that BSOD are a security feature to prevent further damage to some folks. this blog post is very well written :D

[2024-08-08 14:48] diversenok: Thanks!

I know you were referring to other "recent events" in the tweet, but this article has another case where a BSOD (black screen in this case, not blue, since it's winload... but anyway) would have prevented further damage

Downgrade attacks: researchers took over the Windows Update process to make the term “fully patched” meaningless on any Windows machine.

[2024-08-09 16:26] Matti: in particular this chain of events

Yeah, that's an interesting example and a nice article

[2024-08-09 16:45] Matti: yeah - not being very familiar with WU, I was surprised at some of the oversights found

[2024-08-09 16:46] Matti: I bet this attack would fail on my system though

[2024-08-09 16:46] Matti: WU can't even *update* the system correctly, so it would surely fail to downgrade it

[2024-08-10 22:31] daax: no dielectric hooks. BORING. jk it's a super neat bug

[2024-08-10 22:31] diversenok: Where is the underlying physics

[2024-08-10 22:32] diversenok: We need to hack it

my mspaint skills couldn't handle getting smaller than the dielectric circle <:kekW:626450502279888906>

INTERPOSE THE BAND GAPS

[2024-08-10 22:34] diversenok: Ah, yes, what is a dielectric if not a band gap

Was on a defcon presentation.

[2024-08-10 22:36] Azrael: Didn't watch it myself.

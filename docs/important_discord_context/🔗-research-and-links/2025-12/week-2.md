[2025-12-11 07:41] ReaP: A while ago, someone pointed out the strange behavior of the VPGATHER instructions and their ability to allow virtual addresses to be checked for their validity before they are truly accessed. Due to the increasing awareness of this behavior, I have decided to release brief a user-mode proof of concept. For any questions or input, feel free to contact me.

[2025-12-11 18:23] Pwnosaur: Hi everyone, I'm new here in this server (I reviewed the rules and hoping I'm posting to the right channel) , I'm working on a series of blog posts about memory and it's management that will later on progress into more advanced topics. I'm trying to lower the barrier of entry and explain the memory in very simple terms and analogies. I'm sure that many if not most of people over here are seasoned and well knowledgable about these topics, therefore my intention of sharing is to get feedback and review for the content, if you see anything that may be improved, I would be happy to do that and of course give credit to whoever helps. 

here is the blog : https://pwnosaur.com/

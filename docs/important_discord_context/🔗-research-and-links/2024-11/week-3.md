[2024-11-11 23:13] mishap: > The article explains the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) boot process in modern PCs, covering how power-on initialization begins with the Security (SEC) phase. The boot process involves the Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME) in Intel platforms, which manages platform security and controls the CPU’s startup. CSME verifies firmware components to ensure system trust, initiating Trusted Computing Base (TCB) through cryptographic verification of each boot phase. Verified Boot mode, using Intel’s Boot Guard, adds security by authenticating code before execution, establishing a dual root-of-trust between the CSME and CPU, ultimately preparing the system for the operating system.

I’ve read a little, and it looks great for beginners. Has anyone already read it?

[2024-11-15 15:29] dinero: for your own good you should learn to write without LLMs and moreover should write without them

[2024-11-15 15:31] dinero: unless youre ESL and not proficient, then fair enough i guess

+ always nice to see ones github repos is referenced in others repos, it's a sign one does something useful, this keeps one going ^_^
(the reverse shells I have done was referenced in that (and in a blogpost about it) I can paste them here as well ofc, in hope for them to be useful
- (I dont think I have posted them here before, if I have, point it out! https://github.com/loneicewolf/ReverseShells )

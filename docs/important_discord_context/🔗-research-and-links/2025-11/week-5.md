Eh I can personally look past it, the content is good, and technically interesting.

where can i find spi docs for amd ?

[2025-11-26 15:11] Satoshi: depends on what you are looking for. some high level and registers are in PPR (see "Fusion Controller Hub (FCH)" section) but the layout are, afaik, not documented in public docs. 

But most likely you can find all you need to get started by reading existing code that deals with AMD firmware and/or AMD platform security like Platbox, Chipsec, coreboot,  EDK2-platform, and UEFITool. I would suggest starting with Platbox if you are interested in reproducing similar research to that article. Platbox is for that and written in straightforward fashion.

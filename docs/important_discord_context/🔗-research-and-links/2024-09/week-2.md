After almost two months of development, explorer7 is finally available for PUBLIC BETA TESTING! Based on tihiy's old "Windo

[2024-09-05 14:33] Matti: \>github link
\>contains binaries, no source code
this should be grounds to have a repo removed IMO

[2024-09-05 14:36] Matti: also did they really do all this work to port the aero shit to windows $current, but fail to do the same for the classic theme

[2024-09-05 14:36] Matti: strong disapprove

[2024-09-05 14:44] Azrael: [replying to Matti: "\>github link

Agreed.

isnt aero the best one? 😆

[2024-09-05 14:58] estrellas: but yeah, i agree with your concern

[2024-09-05 14:59] estrellas: they have a discord server too, i can send to you if interested

[2024-09-05 16:19] Matti: [replying to estrellas: "isnt aero the best one? 😆"]
I mean....



...no...

[2024-09-05 16:20] Matti: there's the classic theme, and there's the rest

[2024-09-05 16:20] Matti: [replying to estrellas: "they have a discord server too, i can send to you ..."]
tbh I'd be more inclined to join a discord if there was source code on the github page

[2024-09-05 16:48] estrellas: fair lol

[2024-09-07 03:28] Matti: lmao, very satisfying to see that clipsp.sys is exactly as poorly written as I always expected it to be

[2024-09-07 03:29] Matti: lame move by talos

[2024-09-07 03:50] daax: [replying to WitherOrNot: "https://massgrave.dev/blog/keyhole"]
based that they released all their stuff.

[2024-09-07 08:39] Azrael: [replying to WitherOrNot: "https://massgrave.dev/blog/keyhole"]
Well done.

[2024-09-07 08:47] Oliver: [replying to WitherOrNot: "https://massgrave.dev/blog/keyhole"]
nice research

[2024-09-07 08:47] Oliver: i like the xbox ending

[2024-09-07 18:52] root: nice post

[2024-09-07 21:22] May: [replying to Matti: "lame move by talos"]
btw, we talked with the guy who reported it, it was reported bc it allowed other vulnerabilities to be exploited

[2024-09-07 21:23] May: so it wasn't bc Phillippe just loves DRM or smth like that

[2024-09-07 21:23] May: it was part of an exploit chain, though probably not a security vulnerability itself

[2024-09-07 21:33] Matti: mm I see

[2024-09-07 21:34] Matti: yeah that nuances the situation a bit

[2024-09-07 21:34] Matti: but not enough lol

[2024-09-07 21:34] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: a very friendly person i must add

[2024-09-07 21:34] Matti: I still think it's lame

[2024-09-07 21:34] Matti: security people are like a one track mind

[2024-09-07 21:35] Matti: whatever they are working on is alway more important than anyone else's concerns related to the same thing

[2024-09-07 21:35] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: the microsoft technique of preventing exploitation by spamming warbird everywhere evidently didn’t work

[2024-09-07 21:37] May: [replying to Matti: "whatever they are working on is alway more importa..."]
it's not a major loss since we can use older versions for testing, tho if they continue to change clipsp in future versions research there will become harder

[2024-09-07 21:38] Matti: ya, I figured it would be something like that for you guys

[2024-09-07 21:38] Matti: I don't think clipsp is done giving gifts yet if that code is representative

[2024-09-07 21:38] May: If it ends up being relevant for the Xbox it would be a bit sad tho

[2024-09-07 21:41] Matti: I'm only veeery distantly familiar with the current PS5 research scene, and not at all with xbox stuff

[2024-09-07 21:41] Matti: but those platforms are crazy to me

[2024-09-07 21:41] Matti: both of them

[2024-09-07 21:42] Matti: and the lengths they (MS and sony) went to to secure them

[2024-09-07 21:45] Matti: it's also somewhat of a crazy gamble in terms of money invested in DRM (hundreds of millions)
which can all be wiped away in one night by the wrong easy to make fuckup somewhere

[2024-09-07 21:46] Matti: they seem to be doing very well though (I think?) so the gamble is working out

[2024-09-07 21:48] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: they have this insistence of spamming cryptography everywhere to try and secure this stuff but the problem is that often the keys are incredibly poorly protected

[2024-09-07 21:50] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: a side effect of this is that if you can convince a part of the system to approve something once, it can end up being trusted by the rest of the system indefinitely

[2024-09-07 21:53] Matti: I don't really want to debate you on this since I basically don't know shit about consoles in the first place
but from what I hear from people working on PS5 stuff I doubt very much they'd agree that dumping or extracting the keys* is easy or that they are poorly protected

*there are multiple keys of multiple types

[2024-09-07 21:53] Azrael: Microsoft gives out licenses and certificates left and right, I really don't understand their verification process.

[2024-09-07 21:54] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: sorry, i was specifically talking about microsoft with that statement

[2024-09-07 21:54] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: however I only have the context of desktop windows, not their own funky specialised hardware for xbox

[2024-09-07 21:54] Matti: I do think what you are saying was true in the past for sure, for reference

[2024-09-07 21:54] Matti: on PS4 at least

[2024-09-07 21:55] Matti: but again this is mostly me guessing things based on what I hear every now and then

[2024-09-07 21:55] Matti: and where the differences lie between the two

[2024-09-07 21:55] Matti: (generations, not platforms)

[2024-09-07 21:56] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: [replying to 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: "however I only have the context of desktop windows..."]
this is how the original server side windows license exploit worked in a nutshell

[2024-09-07 21:56] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: they ship a binary with an rsa whitebox to sign license tickets which can be redeemed server side if it’s satisfied with your current activation state

[2024-09-07 21:56] Azrael: The original HWID activation method?

[2024-09-07 21:56] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: but nothing stops you tricking it

[2024-09-07 21:56] Azrael: Oh yeah.

[2024-09-07 21:57] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: trick it once, works forever provided you don’t change hardware

[2024-09-07 21:58] 6bd835a1d0095059128d4d8cf6d16171: this sort of attack works in an embarrassing number of parts of the system

[2024-09-07 22:01] Azrael: Very grateful for that one.

Awesome post

congrats on first post.. font is extremely hard to read. if you want to retain or gain readers the format needs to be more friendly on the eyes.

I'm learning reverse engineering through a tutorial that uses IDA Pro. Is there any difference if I use this instead?

You will drop cool factor by substantial percent.

[2024-10-29 00:17] EfraimDays: Okay. I'm going to try using Ghidra instead. thanks

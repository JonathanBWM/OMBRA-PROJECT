99,9% of them are though :p

[2025-11-19 16:27] diversenok: Where did you find that many bad gotos?

[2025-11-19 16:38] Horsie: in my code

[2025-11-19 16:38] Horsie: sorry about that

[2025-11-21 08:54] Xits: what is a good way to generate expressions for n variable linear mba generation? I've seen these expressions used in 2 projects https://github.com/za233/Polaris-Obfuscator/blob/main/src/llvm/include/llvm/Transforms/Obfuscation/LinearMBA.h#L23 , but Im not sure where it comes from exactly? For n variables you only need (2^n + 1) expressions afaik. Whats the reason for choosing 14 and are there any papers on this?

[2025-11-21 08:57] Xits: My current idea is to use quine mcclusky to generate them, but im not sure if that's the best way or how many I should use for n variables.

[2025-11-21 19:19] plpg: Not sure why 14 is chosen, thats probably how many sensible (unique) expressions you can make with this set of operators and two variables

[2025-11-21 19:20] plpg: The latter n-variable expression could probably be generated by choosing from operator and variable sets

[2025-11-21 20:39] Brit: [replying to Xits: "what is a good way to generate expressions for n v..."]
all possible non constant boolean operations

[2025-11-21 23:35] Brit: although now that I've read their expressions, I have to wonder if they knew what they were doing since expr 8 and 3 are equivalent

[2025-11-21 23:44] plpg: I have a feeling they just came up with an arbitrary list of them

[2025-11-21 23:44] Brit: I mean it'd make sense for it to be 14

[2025-11-21 23:44] Brit: right?

[2025-11-21 23:45] Brit: 2^4 - 2

[2025-11-21 23:45] plpg: Yeah where the remaining two are all-1 and all-0

[2025-11-21 23:46] plpg: Or, \mathfrac{-1} and \mathfrac{0}

[2025-11-21 23:46] Addison: could always do the funny and reverse the e-graph reductions of ruler

[2025-11-21 23:47] Addison: https://github.com/uwplse/ruler

[2025-11-21 23:48] Addison: (I know nothing about MBA obfuscation so maybe this is irrelevant)

[2025-11-21 23:50] Addison: anyway, this thing derives such expressions with arbitrary number of variables from constraint solvers

[2025-11-21 23:50] Addison: Normally for optimization but you can always go backwards

[2025-11-21 23:51] plpg: Reminds me to finish my ~~paper~~ loose notes about MBEs and ring algebra

[2025-11-22 11:22] avx: [replying to Addison: "https://github.com/uwplse/ruler"]
this is neat

[2025-11-22 13:50] Xits: [replying to Brit: "all possible non constant boolean operations"]
Why all possible?

[2025-11-22 13:50] Xits: I get you’d want more than (2^n) + 1 to get a good combination of expressions but doing all 2^2^n truth tables seems overkill no?

[2025-11-22 13:52] Xits: And why not include the always 1 constant Boolean operation? In the papers I read they seem to include 1 as an expression

[2025-11-22 13:53] plpg: The always-1 is a useful term

[2025-11-22 13:55] Brit: [replying to Xits: "And why not include the always 1 constant Boolean ..."]
I assume there is a reason they excluded the constant 1 or 0 ops

[2025-11-22 13:55] Brit: that has to do with how they construct their expressions

[2025-11-22 13:55] Brit: but since they excluded those two and added two xnors

[2025-11-22 13:55] Brit: I am not sure what they are doing

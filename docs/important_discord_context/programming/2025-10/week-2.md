I hate this shit so much

[2025-10-09 17:49] Matti: I always just put a checkmark by protest instead of my signature

[2025-10-09 17:49] Matti: haven't had issues with this yet, no one checks this stuff anyway

hahaha I feel that. I do a smiley face or just scribbles now on the tablets and stuff lol

[2025-10-09 18:01] Matti: I actually had to do it properly for the first time earlier just today

[2025-10-09 18:02] Matti: my mum asked me to forge her signature on some POS site that was broken in firefox

[2025-10-09 18:02] Matti: it's got her full name in it and not in cursive either

[2025-10-09 18:02] Matti: the result was amazing honestly, in a bad way

[2025-10-09 18:18] pinefin: i scribble like im a rock star giving a autograph

[2025-10-09 18:45] Timmy: I do single pixel on the tablets

[2025-10-09 23:39] UJ: what about those websites that ask for a sig (cough hireright uncough), you can type it out but it uses a cursive font?

this is equally pointless but tbh I still find it less irritating than having to draw a signature with a fucking mouse, as if that somehow makes it more genuine

[2025-10-10 14:13] Matti:

[2025-10-10 17:37] c0z: Used to sign as Daffy Duck but in cursive

[2025-10-12 07:57] plpg: In electronic documents a squiggle signatrue has no practical use as you can make ideal copies of digital data (so you can copy someone's signature)

[2025-10-12 07:58] plpg: I have a png of my signature that I paste into documents which need a signature but are issued by orgs which don't support electronic signatures

[2025-10-12 07:58] plpg: Its so funny and doesnt make sense but its a common practice

[2025-10-12 07:59] the horse: yeah only makes sense with 3rd party stamps that have done KYC

[2025-10-12 08:00] plpg: Not even KYC, there is a national service here which lets you sign documents with PAdES / XAdES

[2025-10-12 08:01] the horse: true

[2025-10-12 08:03] plpg: [replying to the horse: "true"]
Unrelated but MBA in your nick name refers to mixed boolean arithmetics?

[2025-10-12 08:04] the horse: yes

[2025-10-12 08:04] plpg: Neat. I'm writing a small paper about them

[2025-10-12 08:05] the horse: 🙏

[2025-10-12 17:23] moneytherapy: yo guys

[2025-10-12 17:24] moneytherapy: what ways are for retrieving disk serials..?

[2025-10-12 17:31] Brandon: [replying to moneytherapy: "what ways are for retrieving disk serials..?"]
The easiest is checking `/dev/disk/by-id` on Linux

[2025-10-12 17:32] moneytherapy: [replying to Brandon: "The easiest is checking `/dev/disk/by-id` on Linux"]
is m sking for windows

[2025-10-12 17:32] moneytherapy: ia*

[2025-10-12 17:33] Brandon: In Microsoft I assume it's https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getvolumeinformationa
[Embed: GetVolumeInformationA function (fileapi.h) - Win32 apps]
Retrieves information about the file system and volume associated with the specified root directory. (ANSI)

[2025-10-12 17:33] moneytherapy: except for c4lling IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY

[2025-10-12 19:26] plpg: Programatically or just as a one time thing?

[2025-10-12 19:27] plpg: If latter then you can just boot mhdd and read it there

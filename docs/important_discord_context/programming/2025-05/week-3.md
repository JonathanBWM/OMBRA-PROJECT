[2025-05-13 01:25] truckdad: from my teaching days: an unfortunate number of students who failed to realize that this meant they were not running the code they just wrote

[2025-05-13 01:26] truckdad: reflexive "yes? oh ok, yes!"

[2025-05-13 01:26] diversenok: Just show me the error already!

On accident 😅

[2025-05-13 12:26] elias: Does the modern Windows on ARM use IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ARM as architecture identifier?

[2025-05-13 12:26] elias: or IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ARMNT?

[2025-05-13 12:31] Brit: p sure its actually IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ARM64

[2025-05-13 12:31] Brit: but ill check once Im home

[2025-05-13 12:42] diversenok: Modern is 64-bit, thus,`IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ARM64`

[2025-05-13 12:43] diversenok: Older 32-bit is `IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ARMNT`

[2025-05-13 12:46] diversenok: Except for the boot manager, which can be `IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_THUMB`

[2025-05-13 12:47] diversenok: See the previous discussion: https://discord.com/channels/835610998102425650/835667591393574919/1364927119402209342

[2025-05-13 13:28] elias: thank you very much

[2025-02-18 17:02] James: And in reality

[2025-02-18 17:02] James: Nobody cares about cache throughput at all!

[2025-02-18 17:03] James: Unless ur writing avx code, and you have a lot of threads, only the latency should matter right?

[2025-02-18 17:03] James: I could have a cache with 20Tb/s throughout but a latency of two years

[2025-02-18 17:04] James: Good example is the pigeon travel protocol

wait really??

reminds me of one of my stepdad's professors saying something like "never underestimate the raw bandwidth of a pickup truck full of 1GB hard drives"

[2025-02-18 19:16] Torph: correction it was "Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of magnetic tapes hurtling down the highway"

[2025-02-18 23:21] brockade: this is still a thing

[2025-02-18 23:23] brockade: iirc amazon has a data backup option where they send a semi truck and just plug directly into the SAN

[2025-02-18 23:23] brockade: also TCP tuning is an artform

i read google also does this for something

[2025-02-21 07:07] UJ: bro, this guy is still doing meth - https://github.com/SleepTheGod?tab=repositories

[2025-02-21 07:09] Matti: you're not?

[2025-02-21 07:10] UJ: at least his newer chatgpt projects are actual looking projects and not some fake windows atom hijacker hallucination.

[2025-02-21 07:11] Matti: meth is a solid productivity booster, but a bit strong probably

[2025-02-21 07:11] Matti: so the productivity may be in unexpected directions

[2025-02-21 07:12] UJ: actually nvm i stand corrected - https://github.com/SleepTheGod/DiscordBlockBypass

[2025-02-21 07:13] UJ: why is he doing this?

[2025-02-21 07:13] Matti: still, it's always at least better to be a meth user than an alcoholic

you talking from experience?

[2025-02-21 12:39] sync: Matti OS fuels your meth addiction.. huh..

[2025-02-21 12:43] Matti: no, I've never done meth

[2025-02-21 12:43] Matti: I just stick with plain amphetamines like everybody else

[2025-02-21 12:43] 5pider: ong

[2025-02-21 12:44] 5pider: give this man some amphetamines

[2025-02-21 12:45] Matti: I'm not really short on supply

[2025-02-21 12:45] 5pider: lmfao

[2025-02-21 12:45] Matti: but you are free to contribute to my epyc workstation instead

[2025-02-21 12:46] Matti: I checked under the couch and there was no 15K eur there either

[2025-02-21 12:46] Matti: so I'm out of options really

[2025-02-21 12:50] sync: [replying to Matti: "I'm not really short on supply"]
i heard some people are

[2025-02-21 12:50] sync: maybe they would pay 15K eur..

[2025-02-21 12:52] Matti: I've got plenty of amphetamines for personal use, but somehow I doubt anyone would make that trade

[2025-02-21 12:52] Matti: it's not *that* much

[2025-02-21 12:53] Matti: also I'm not a drug dealer, at least not by trade

[2025-02-21 12:53] Matti: only occasionally

[2025-02-21 13:44] sync: sad, it’s a good business

[2025-02-21 15:00] Sheep: Sometimes I really struggle to tell whether reverse engineers are joking or not 😂

I need to get on his level.

[2025-02-23 06:07] vmx: man's got chatgpt working overtime

[2025-02-23 06:08] UJ: [replying to vmx: "https://github.com/SleepTheGod/LinuxProcInject/blo..."]
to be fair, the repo did say its a proof of concept. it just needs the proof and the concept.

[2025-02-23 06:08] vmx: https://github.com/bot984397/injector/tree/main

[2025-02-23 06:09] vmx: this does actually work and keeps the original process intact by creating a new thread

[2025-02-23 06:09] vmx: far from perfect, but works as a proof of concept (with proof and concept)

[2025-02-23 22:32] UJ: Do these videos look legit or a waste of time for a uefi crash course? https://www.youtube.com/@QuesoFuego/videos

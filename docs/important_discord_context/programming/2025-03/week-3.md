maybe it prefers big letters

[2025-03-12 22:49] sync: who knows..

[2025-03-12 22:49] vmx: it also tends to make shit up very frequently, so there's that

[2025-03-13 16:05] sariaki: jarvis, allocate 6 Tb for this string real quick

guys all of this is now easily within reach with a simple 8 socket board and the power of Intel(R) Optane(TM) PMEM NVDIMMs

[2025-03-13 18:34] Matti: alas, I only had money for a single socket board, so this is a mere 2 TB

[2025-03-13 18:35] Matti: also it's a broken piece of shit system, but for unrelated reasons

[2025-03-13 18:37] Matti: WRK support will be on the TODO list for a while, every windows bootloader prior to windows 11 (or late win 10) breaks on this configuration with a black screen of death :/

[2025-03-13 18:38] Matti: I feel like it must be ACPI related

[2025-03-13 18:39] Matti: every issue that is total bullshit is always in some way related to ACPI

[2025-03-13 18:39] Matti: people have had way more than 2 TB in systems for ages

[2025-03-13 18:40] Matti: but these NVDIMMs are published to 2 or 3 ACPI tables that the OS needs to be aware of (and apparently the bootloader too)

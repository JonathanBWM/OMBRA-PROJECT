[2024-12-31 19:03] SYAZ: Hello, does someone know why ``ObReferenceObjectByName`` always returns 0xC0000005 ( access violation) when trying to do a syscall with VDM (https://github.com/backengineering/VDM). When doing it in a normal kernel driver it works fine. I've tried passing the same arguments in the driver and in usermode with VDM but it won't work. Does someone know a fix for that or know why it happens?

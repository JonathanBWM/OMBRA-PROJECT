[2024-12-02 14:38] Deleted User: whats the thought process of advertising on a platform full of crypto scammers/bots and connecting it to a legitimate discord that has nothing to do with that topic whatsoever..

[2024-12-02 14:39] Brit: "legitimate"

[2024-12-02 14:39] zeropio: grabbing as much money as you can, then run away

[2024-12-02 14:40] Brit: this is literally what happens when you have no elitism

[2024-12-02 14:40] Deleted User: [replying to Brit: ""legitimate""]
well with people that arent bots and have an interest in the topic of the discord 😭 assembly and shitcoins couldnt be further away

[2024-12-02 14:41] Torph: i think you can have mostly no elitism and still kick crypto scammers

doesn't matter, it's just for the illusion of legitimacy as brit says

[2024-12-02 14:42] Deleted User: yeah

[2024-12-02 14:42] Brit: sure, I'm joking mostly, it used to be an accusation levied on places I used to hang out in when i was younger, idiots were ruthlessly bullied, and it had the nice property of also running off people that would have taken advantage of said idiots

[2024-12-02 14:42] x86matthew: same reason they keep posting a screenshot of elon musk's one word reply to tetsuo on twitter months ago

[2024-12-02 14:44] Torph: <:kekw:904522300257345566> hey man you're the one that said "when i was younger"

[2024-12-02 14:50] zeropio: [replying to Brit: "sure, I'm joking mostly, it used to be an accusati..."]
I think there is a big step between elitism and a crypto scam

[2024-12-02 14:50] zeropio: but the guy is an interaction farmer on twitter, I wouldn't expect less

[2024-12-02 15:51] Torph: [replying to lucabtz: "The name is also from akira"]
the name tetsuo? that's crazy

[2024-12-02 15:52] Torph: I was thinking of Tetsuo from the show Astrid

[2024-12-02 15:56] Brit: isn't it just a common japanese name?

[2024-12-02 15:56] Brit: pretty sure I've seen Tetsuos on linkedin before

[2024-12-02 15:56] lucabtz: [replying to Brit: "isn't it just a common japanese name?"]
Most likely, but I think it is referencing Akira seeing the tweets

[2024-12-02 15:57] lucabtz: And the guy is american

[2024-12-02 15:57] estrellas: yeah im p sure it references the anime

[2024-12-03 02:27] lucabtz: [replying to VTA/APT: "rust> everything else"]
I think rust gives some false sense of safety. It is safer than c for sure but there is plenty of code using unsafe in many libraries so bugs will be there too. And if you want to do the exact same stuff you do in c you need safe wrappers for unsafe code, however the safety of those wrappers isn't guaranteed by any mechanism other than the programmer and we know programmers can make mistakes

[2024-12-03 02:29] lucabtz: The surface where bugs may be though it drastically reduced which makes it a great thing

[2024-12-03 02:37] VTA/APT: hmm

[2024-12-03 05:08] North: [replying to VTA/APT: "https://tenor.com/view/rust-programmers-c-cve-memo..."]
Maybe thats because C has been around since 1972

[2024-12-03 05:08] North: And people care about money and the product not CVEs

[2024-12-03 05:10] North: Personally I moved to Rust for reasons other than safety, its not that hard to write safe C++

yes, it is

[2024-12-03 07:49] roddux: as browsers continually prove

[2024-12-03 07:50] roddux: we will have memory safety issues as long as memory unsafe languages are used

how much that _matters_ is up for debate

[2024-12-03 07:51] BWA RBX: [replying to North: "Personally I moved to Rust for reasons other than ..."]
I disagree I think on the contrary, C++ is difficult depending on what type of software is being programmed

[2024-12-03 08:28] North: Sorry I should have added to that

[2024-12-03 08:30] North: its not that hard to write safe C++... if you spend years on the modern C++ grind

[2024-12-03 08:35] North: But after spending way too much time learning modern C++, I can't expect newer developers to go through all that.

[2024-12-03 08:37] North: and in my mind... newer Rust developers might just write code that is slower and has excess memory allocations while a newer C++ developer might start accidentally writing some C and write some bugs!

[2024-12-03 08:39] North: [replying to North: "and in my mind... newer Rust developers might just..."]
But that's just my guess right now, I still haven't spent a ton of time with Rust, and I haven't really had the opportunity to work in large teams in either language.

The correct use of unsafe is [largely documented](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) and large rust projects often either audit them, or avoid them. Most *blessed* crates (understand mainstream crates) will advertise themselves as `#[forbid(unsafe_code)]` if they do not contain any `unsafe`. This macro forces the compiler to reject any use of unsafe and give you the guarantee the code you're importing is MS/DB. Even if a crate contains unsafe code, the community has been very quick (almost immediate) to react to auditing the unsafe parts, not because of charity, but because of ego, the sweet pleasure of proving to someone he f*cked up. There are also `lints` to make a compiler warning if you don't define a SAFETY documentation at EACH unsafe code explaining why it works.
Yeah, unsafe is a thing, but its like very small part compared to a project and its more easier to make things right because its in your mental scope. With C, you can shoot yourself in the foot at any time, anywhere, anyhow. So I don't think it give a false sense of security

If what you want is switching the entire allocator at once, then a custom allocator reading a global state could do

[2024-12-03 10:25] jonaslyk: and i assume it would switch what the cpp allocator generated

[2024-12-03 10:26] Deleted User: allocator are traits in rust, so you can wrap multiple ones in a single one

[2024-12-03 10:26] jonaslyk: but- it sounds like a bad idea to do, will require tracking of what allocatior was used when need to free

[2024-12-03 10:27] Deleted User: [replying to jonaslyk: "but- it sounds like a bad idea to do, will require..."]
no. rust allocation primitives are deduplicated at compilation to their specific allocator.
`Vec<u8> = Vec<u8, A> where A: Allocator` so the type in itself will always `Drop` by `A`

[2024-12-03 10:27] Deleted User: `Vec<u8, Mimalloc> != Vec<u8, jemalloc>`

[2024-12-03 10:28] Deleted User: [replying to jonaslyk: "but the questing was about runtime"]
can you add a custom allocator at runtime and replace the current one? the answer is no

[2024-12-03 10:28] Deleted User: at least rust doesn't support such

[2024-12-03 10:28] Deleted User: you can always exploit the linker

I don't think large documentation is the problem. There is a way larger documentation on memory issues in C but the bugs are still there. There have been memory safety bugs in rust even in the standard library so saying all unsafe code is actually safe because people audited the code doesn't really matter. I ain't saying it isn't better than C. The portion of the code that needs to be audited is way smaller and thus is way easier to do it. All I'm saying is that some operations need to be unsafe by nature and memory safety bugs can and will be in those parts of the code

I didn't say false security I said false safety. The point is that rust is a series of safe wrappers around unsafe code (and it must be, I mean any safe language is tbh)  so memory safety bugs can still exist in those wrappers and historically there have been some

Hey all, I don’t know if I need to post this but my reputation is important to me and I def want to nip any rumors in the bud. I don’t want to make this a topic of discussion here but my DMs are open. tl;dr I am not part of some crypto grift. I was alerted by chance and then offered some funding for the next 6mo which was good timing because I put in notice at my work last Monday so I was trying to help Tetsuo answer questions while he was setting up a website. I’ve known him a few years and he sent me a GPU on my sabbatical a couple years ago so that’s why I was inclined to be helpful. I still don’t think it’s a grift but it obviously did upset that server/community.

hmmm there's a "TinyOS" repo and a disk driver, but the comments say "author: Mike Walker" and describe it as an emulator? i actually can't tell if it's a native driver or emulator or what

dude my C professor at uni insisted on using a generic tree node with a `void*` to a specialized tree node (in 2 different allocations), instead of a tagged union (because the union would "waste space on each node"), it pissed me off so much

[2024-12-03 20:06] Deleted User: `because the union would "waste space on each node"`
ah yes, the famous size difference between two pointer type in C

[2024-12-03 20:07] VTA/APT: did anybody buy $TETSUO

[2024-12-03 20:07] Torph: [replying to Deleted User: "`because the union would "waste space on each node..."]
no he was saying like "if type A is 8 bytes and B is 32, we'd waste 24 bytes storing nodes of type A using a union". which is *true*, but I'd much rather put up with that than have 2 layers of pointer indirection in 2 allocations to get at my data

[2024-12-03 20:09] naci: data oriented design goes hard though

[2024-12-03 20:09] VTA/APT: this chat honestly though, is better than university

[2024-12-03 20:09] Torph: he's also insistent that we check for NULL before calling `free` even though that's well defined, because "it might be implemented wrong on some platforms"

dumb question, but isn't that the idea of unions? to take more space to fit more than one possible thing?

[2024-12-03 20:10] VTA/APT: ```#include <stdlib.h>

void safe_free(void *ptr) {
    if (ptr) {
        free(ptr);

int main() {
    int *ptr = NULL;
    safe_free(ptr);  
    return 0;
}```

[2024-12-03 20:11] Torph: [replying to VTA/APT: "prob for peace of mind"]
there's no peace of mind gained, free(NULL) is *explicitly* defined as a safe no-op

[2024-12-03 20:12] 0xdeluks: [replying to zeropio: "dumb question, but isn't that the idea of unions? ..."]
i thought the idea is to save space by using the same memory space for multiple variables, idk I rarely use unions

[2024-12-03 20:14] Torph: [replying to zeropio: "dumb question, but isn't that the idea of unions? ..."]
yeah exactly, it also means each element is a constant size so it's easier to deal with many types of structures in an array. for some reason a lot of people would rather insert an extra layer of pointers than create a bit of padding

You should pass as double pointer and set it to null after freeing

[2024-12-03 21:22] VTA/APT: not really to show the main part

[2024-12-03 21:23] VTA/APT: u have to reassign the pointer to a mem addr

[2024-12-03 21:56] contificate: but anything "complex" would not be a breeze for you

[2024-12-03 21:56] contificate: I assure you

[2024-12-03 21:57] contificate: structuring a large program with lots of moving pieces and ideas is a complex task

[2024-12-03 22:01] contificate: a breeze is like

[2024-12-05 06:22] Torph: is this what it feels like to learn Python with no programming experience

[2024-12-05 06:25] richinseattle: LLMs are pretty good at python if you need a tutor

[2024-12-05 06:25] richinseattle: sys.stdin.read() should be all you need there tho?

[2024-12-05 08:04] dinero: re-read what he wrote

[2024-12-05 08:04] dinero: he’s learning ocaml not python

why you learning OCaml?

i wanted to do prolog for it last year

[2024-12-05 08:45] roddux: but didn't get past "how the fuck do i read from stdin"

[2024-12-05 11:14] richinseattle: [replying to dinero: "he’s learning ocaml not python"]
I was confused by the 'is this what it feels like' I have written a lot of ocaml in the past, just lost the thread of thought I guess. but yeah I/O with ocaml is less straightforward with a base install heh

[2024-12-05 11:54] contificate: Advent of code in OCaml will devolve to imperative algorithms probably

[2024-12-05 12:13] VTA/APT: yeah

[2024-12-05 12:19] richinseattle: thats one of the nice things about ocaml is its not pure functional

[2024-12-05 13:00] contificate: It's good when it's good but doing those exercises will teach little in the way of OCaml

[2024-12-05 13:04] lucabtz: [replying to richinseattle: "thats one of the nice things about ocaml is its no..."]
ah then Haskell >>

[2024-12-05 13:50] contificate: Haskell is garbo

[2024-12-05 13:51] contificate: People love to love it but it's awful for engineering software with and its tooling ecosystem and compile times are suicidal

[2024-12-05 13:53] Saturnalia: [replying to contificate: "People love to love it but it's awful for engineer..."]
good thing nobody uses it for non memeware so there aren't projects big enough for that to be a problem :^)

[2024-12-05 13:53] contificate: OCaml is used for non memeware though so it's all good

[2024-12-05 14:13] estrellas: examples?

[2024-12-05 14:16] Brit: Just the entire janestreet stack

[2024-12-05 14:17] estrellas: but *what* in it? honest question btw

[2024-12-05 15:12] lucabtz: [replying to contificate: "People love to love it but it's awful for engineer..."]
i was just kidding: i like haskell because i love maths, but it is painful to use i agree

[2024-12-05 15:47] contificate: I don't find Haskell very mathematical

[2024-12-05 15:47] contificate: As for OCaml, there's Mirage and Citrix Hypervisor's toolstack, all OCaml running in Xen's dom0 - so the code is all systems level stuff mostly

[2024-12-05 15:48] contificate: Jane Street do a lot in it as well, they hire hundreds of engineers to write it

[2024-12-05 15:48] contificate: Facebook and Google have compilers written in OCaml

[2024-12-05 16:03] Torph: [replying to vendor: "why you learning OCaml?"]
heard good things about it, and advent of code is a good time to learn a lang without inheriting tons of technical debt on a real project

[2024-12-05 16:03] BWA RBX: In the end I find all programming mathematical in one sense

[2024-12-05 16:05] Torph: [replying to richinseattle: "I was confused by the 'is this what it feels like'..."]
I meant like I can't remember the last time I was this completely lost learning about a language or API

[2024-12-05 16:05] BWA RBX: [replying to BWA RBX: "In the end I find all programming mathematical in ..."]
inb4 if you're a mathematician, you'll truly understand the correctness of this statement

[2024-12-05 16:25] lucabtz: [replying to contificate: "I don't find Haskell very mathematical"]
i mean monads, functors and stuff is all mathematics

[2024-12-05 16:25] lucabtz: i kinda like the abstract nonsense of category theory

[2024-12-05 17:23] contificate: well

[2024-12-05 17:23] contificate: that's a view but those concepts as used in software

[2024-12-05 17:23] contificate: are really just design patterns

[2024-12-05 17:23] contificate: monads are a generalisation of CPS, I use them daily as a source-level way of working inside async concurrency libraries

[2024-12-05 17:24] contificate: at no point do I think "does this monad actually satisfy the monad laws?"

[2024-12-05 17:24] contificate: and functors are so trivial a concept it's almost not worth talking about it mathematically

[2024-12-05 17:24] contificate: I think advent of code is a bad way to learn OCaml, but that's just me

[2024-12-05 17:27] contificate: anyway, I don't see these things about mathematics and Haskell to be negative

[2024-12-05 17:27] contificate: it's just that, actually, Haskell alienates a lot of people who would otherwise get into FP

[2024-12-05 17:27] contificate: they think you require some strong mathematical background, which you do not at all

[2024-12-05 17:27] contificate: and Haskell is the exception to the rule in most cases (example: pervasive laziness)

[2024-12-05 17:27] contificate: for some reason, lots of non-FP programmers have heard of Haskell

[2024-12-05 17:28] contificate: but not Scala or F# or OCaml

[2024-12-05 17:28] contificate: of which there are more programs running in production written in those languages

[2024-12-05 17:28] contificate: so I destroy this larp every time I come across it

[2024-12-05 17:28] contificate: you can think it's neat to think at the level of typeclasses that encode basic concepts from abstract algebra

[2024-12-05 17:29] contificate: but don't let it distract you from what's important about programming

[2024-12-05 17:29] contificate: which is actually expressing ideas

[2024-12-05 17:37] Torph: [replying to contificate: "I think advent of code is a bad way to learn OCaml..."]
how would you go about learning it instead?

[2024-12-05 17:41] contificate: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html is not bad, or so I've heard

[2024-12-05 17:41] contificate: I disagree with a bit of what it teaches

[2024-12-05 17:41] contificate: but really the point is like

[2024-12-05 17:41] contificate: functional programming has its own idioms and ideas

[2024-12-05 17:41] contificate: and has features that are becoming more mainstream but still not everywhere

[2024-12-05 17:41] contificate: like ADTs and pattern matching

[2024-12-05 17:41] contificate: there's nothing inherentely functional about those two

[2024-12-05 17:42] contificate: it just so happens FP lang designers knew to include them

[2024-12-05 17:42] contificate: I posted a list of neat ideas that follow on from a basic education in FP

[2024-12-05 17:42] contificate: https://discord.com/channels/835610998102425650/835664858526646313/1313593001964208180

[2024-12-05 17:42] contificate: all of those have many rabbit holes within him

[2024-12-05 17:43] contificate: like defunctionalisation of CPS can be used to derive abstract machines: you start with an interpreter, convert it into CPS, and defunctionalise it and - since continuations represent "what to do next" and have the required free variables as part of their environment - the defunctionalisation continuations represent abstract states for machine transitions

[2024-12-05 17:44] contificate: some other relations to things like trampolining CPS, which is similar to some other stuff, like basic schedulers implemented using stackful corotuines reified dynamically at runtime

[2024-12-05 21:02] VTA/APT: <@687117677512360003> , bro is gonna become the top programming language theorist in the world

[2024-12-05 21:05] pinefin: c++ philosopher*

[2024-12-05 21:25] VTA/APT: lol fax

[2024-12-05 21:47] lucabtz: [replying to contificate: "but don't let it distract you from what's importan..."]
Yeah I agree with this

[2024-12-05 21:53] lucabtz: [replying to contificate: "at no point do I think "does this monad actually s..."]
But yeah to me this is interesting instead. I agree it is pointless to do actual programming, but coming from a theoretical physics background where people like to overuse the language of category theory I kinda learnt to appreciate it

[2024-12-06 01:55] richinseattle: If you are into program analysis on binaries, this is a large ocaml based project that is actually useful on real world software https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap

[2024-12-06 01:56] richinseattle: It was the foundation for Mayhem that won the darpa cyber grand challenge. I wrote my own tools against their old version https://github.com/moflow/moflow

If only it wasn’t in ocaml 😦

[2024-12-06 03:24] richinseattle: It has python and C bindings

now i can finally finish the thing i was tryna make , thanks 😄

[2024-12-06 08:49] richinseattle: [replying to 0x208D9: "stripped binary symbol recovery"]
do you know about nucleus? I had to patch it for modern bfd but it was a standalone academic project that finds function boundaries and can generage CFGs for functions etc 
https://bitbucket.org/richinseattle/nucleus/

[2024-12-06 08:49] richinseattle: C++ code

will compile soon and check it out

[2024-12-06 09:15] richinseattle: this is also an interesting project - rust wrapper for the native C decompiler lib in ghidra (lifts to PCODE, not pseudoC)
https://github.com/StarCrossPortal/sleighcraft

[2024-12-06 09:17] richinseattle: > SleighCraft is a decoder (or, linear disassembler) based on ghidra's decompiler implementation. Sleighcraft can be used in Rust or Python, with both high-level and low-level API.
> In general, sleighcraft is just like capstone but with IR and more archs.

[2024-12-06 09:18] richinseattle: combining them gets you a pretty good start on custom binary analysis tools

[2024-12-06 18:40] contificate: [replying to pinefin: "c++ philosopher*"]
been there and done that, waste of years of my life

[2024-12-06 18:40] contificate: can't believe I was obsessed with C++ as a teenager

[2024-12-06 18:41] contificate: just to think where I'd be if I picked up OCaml then instead

[2024-12-06 19:30] dinero: [replying to contificate: "can't believe I was obsessed with C++ as a teenage..."]
right?

[2024-12-06 19:31] dinero: Sometimes my old neuroticism picks up and i want to feel like trivia master. i decided to use const_cast to solve a const mismatch instead of, you know, just stripping the const from the parameter in the call chain

[2024-12-06 19:31] contificate: brain damaging

[2024-12-06 19:32] dinero: 5 minutes later CI fails on my branch

[2024-12-08 19:10] Horsie: Any library that would let me perform direct rpc calls knowing just the opnum, argc and arg sizes?

[2024-12-08 19:10] Horsie: I'm trying to call into an undocumented rpc interface.

[2024-12-08 19:11] Horsie: RpcView's IDL dump looks pretty wrong. I tried fixing it up a bit and putting it in midl to get some stubs but it looks very wrong.

oleview + type libraries | instantiate an object that contains dynamic objects returned as properties, sometimes they provide access to additional methods and then dig through those.

[2024-12-08 21:39] roddux: huh, powershell is more capable than i realised 🤔

[2024-12-08 22:48] richinseattle: even vbscript was decent with COM, but thats the main advantage of powershell as well

[2024-12-08 23:18] luci4: [replying to roddux: "huh, powershell is more capable than i realised 🤔"]
Lol

[2024-12-08 23:19] luci4: It's also the only thing you have on Windows Server core installations (so without GUI)

[2024-12-08 23:19] luci4: its very strong

[2024-12-08 23:21] luci4: I used it a lot with its AD and Hyper-V modules. When it comes to Windows sysadmin, it's unbeatable imo

[2024-12-08 23:25] dullard: [replying to roddux: "huh, powershell is more capable than i realised 🤔"]
It’s not default powershell in case you didn’t know

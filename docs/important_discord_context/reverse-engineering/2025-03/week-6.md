[2025-03-31 19:26] Bored engineer: anyone knows how to bypass google play protect once we build it via msfvenom  ? because google is now not allowing you too install that apk !! but earlier it used to

so far tried :

-> use of shikata nai and x86 encoding ++ other encoding using msfvenom
-> changed the signature of trusted app
->changed the package to the trusted app already in the app store 
-> obfuscated the apk as well
-> encrypted the apk

You're trying to upload a msfvenom payload to google play?

lol no installing in emulator

[2025-03-31 21:45] Bored engineer: [replying to Bored engineer: "lol no installing in emulator"]
install in device also same

???? You can install an apk without going through google play

[2025-03-31 21:45] Bored engineer: [replying to Humpty/Tony: "???? You can install an apk without going through ..."]
nah that defeats the purpose of remote loading don't wanna do it via adb

[2025-03-31 21:46] Humpty/Tony: So luci4 is right, you _are_ trying to upload an msfvenom to Google play lol

[2025-03-31 21:46] Humpty/Tony: You can also just download the apk through the browser

[2025-03-31 21:46] Bored engineer: [replying to Humpty/Tony: "So luci4 is right, you _are_ trying to upload an m..."]
No , that is different , if I will give you the apk via here your device will trigger the google play protect and scan the apk and flag it

I am not trying to submit or publish apk with msfvenom to play store !!

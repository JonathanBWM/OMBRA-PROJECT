[2025-07-29 17:58] Horsie: <@162611465130475520> Why does x64dbg use software breakpoints for single stepping?

[2025-07-29 17:59] Horsie: (and not TF/HWBP)?

[2025-07-29 17:59] Horsie: ~~Any particular reason behind it?~~
Silly of me to ask. Thought about it and they both have their quirks.

It doesn’t

[2025-07-29 19:22] mrexodia: Only if you step _over_ a call

Ah. I observed that and erroneously assumed that to be the general case

Hey, what sort of mod is it? A minecraft client (Lunar, Badlion etc) or a forge mod?

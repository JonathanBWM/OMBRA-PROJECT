the initial leak did not include a licence, none of these licenses are real, the names are made up

[2025-07-04 12:35] sudhackar: I thought the builds are watermarked - and someone figured out who

atlhough works on pervious verisons

[2025-07-05 22:58] Mevas: Idiot

[2025-07-05 22:58] Mevas: Open Ida pro

[2025-07-05 22:58] Mevas: And check why

[2025-07-06 16:00] plox: help pls, big newb here. cant install my program and idk why.

theres no ltrace or strace easily available. found procmon instead. kind of confusing to figure out whats happening. realize these are all event happening in realtime that sound like syscalls and i filtered it down to the specific PID after quickly finding it in task manager before it closes itself

[2025-07-06 16:00] plox: ive figured out my solution to installing the software by other means last night

[2025-07-06 16:00] plox: but as a programmer I want to know WHY i couldnt with the original installer

[2025-07-06 16:01] plox: theres so much information and events related to the PID, im unsure where the failure really was and at the end of this event log its just registry key edits and a lot of it seems like fine and normal behavior?

absolutely insane wtf, currently at problem 5, this is very insipiring!

[2025-10-01 04:11] Horsie: Thanks for the heads up. I know what I'll be doing today

[2025-10-01 10:57] Jacob: [replying to slane: "Does anyone know of an AI that has no restrictions..."]
Yeah for me I ask about like how my friend could do something or how “cheeters” do something. Then ask for an example of what it looks like. Frame it as a learning experience

[2025-10-01 10:59] Jacob: But honestly it’s like learning a new language

[2025-10-01 11:00] Jacob: Like at first you might only know words and phrases

[2025-10-01 11:03] Jacob: But over time you’ll learn how to make full sentences

[2025-10-01 11:03] Jacob: And stories

[2025-10-01 17:13] iPower: don't use AI for any of that. you will thank yourself later

[2025-10-01 17:14] iPower: if you're using AI to learn reverse engineering you're definitely doing it wrong

[2025-10-02 13:07] 0xD3f4ult: hello everyone I'm new to this discord server as well as reverse engineering 
I'm currently reading the book "secrets of reverse engineering" and I'm a bit confused can anyone recommend other books for reverse engineering Thanks in advance.

[2025-10-02 13:09] Brit: the trick to understanding these things is practice, you should try and apply the things you read about or it will never become practical knowledge

[2025-10-02 13:14] 0xD3f4ult: [replying to Brit: "the trick to understanding these things is practic..."]
ok thanks also the assembly generated by x32/64dbg is different from the one in the book, the book uses ollydbg is there any reason why?

[2025-10-02 13:16] Brit: the assembly was not generated by x64dbg, it was generated by a compiler, the dissasembly differs, but the dissasembly of what?

[2025-10-02 13:16] Brit: what are you trying to disassemble

[2025-10-02 13:20] 0xD3f4ult: a program in of the examples "generic table" uses ntdll.dll specifically the export function RtlGetElementGenericTable. I'm so sorry for any inconvenience i'm a total noob

[2025-10-02 13:23] Brit: no worries at all, if the book you are reading is using Olly it is probably a bit older, and it is entierly possible that the function itself has been changed by MS, what does the book say it should look like, and what are you seeing, also how are you finding the function (by the export hopefully?)

[2025-10-02 13:24] Brit: although it should really not have changed given how simple the function is

[2025-10-02 13:27] 0xD3f4ult: can i share a screenshot

[2025-10-02 13:27] Brit: sure

[2025-10-02 13:30] 0xD3f4ult:

[2025-10-02 13:32] 0xD3f4ult: i don't know why the first parameter on the stack is accessed through [ebp+8] i the book but it different in the debugger

[2025-10-02 13:35] truckdad: it looks the same, just in a different order and storing the result in different registers. notice the loads relative to ecx in the book and the loads relative to edi in your debugger; ecx is [ebp+8] in the book and edi is [ebp+8] in your debugger

[2025-10-02 13:36] truckdad: the location of parameters on the stack is part of the ABI so that is going to remain stable, but the register usage inside the function is liable to completely change, since that detail isn't externally visible

[2025-10-02 13:37] Brit: ^

[2025-10-02 13:37] 0xD3f4ult: ohh thanks I'm just seeing it

[2025-10-02 13:38] 0xD3f4ult: sorry for wasting your time on a trivial task

[2025-10-02 13:44] Timmy: [replying to 0xD3f4ult: "sorry for wasting your time on a trivial task"]
imo you shouldn't be worried about that, as long as your question is constructive and it's not something you could have easily answered yourself by googling for 5 minutes.

[2025-10-02 13:47] truckdad: yep, people wouldn't help if they didn't want to help 🙂

[2025-10-02 13:52] 0xD3f4ult: [replying to truckdad: "yep, people wouldn't help if they didn't want to h..."]
thanks again for your help

[2025-10-02 21:25] Windows2000Warrior**: anyone here interested to patch windows 2000 kernel to add XP throttling API , XP ACPI creates ACPI processor objects that need the XP throttling API , i think PROCESSOR_STATE_HANDLER2 should implimented  2k have PROCESSOR_STATE_HANDLER, i can pay 50$ via binance , note we have ACPI and XP hal works on 2k

[2025-10-02 21:29] Brit: this is not 50 usd kind of work in my opinion

[2025-10-02 21:30] the horse: lol

[2025-10-02 21:33] Windows2000Warrior**: [replying to Brit: "this is not 50 usd kind of work in my opinion"]
The server is for volunteers but for a small fee because no one on my server can do this work  , but what do you think about how much it will cost? , i will try to accumulate it

[2025-10-02 21:35] Brit: no idea, I just know it would take me more than an hour, and I bill more hourly.

[2025-10-02 21:38] Windows2000Warrior**: [replying to Brit: "no idea, I just know it would take me more than an..."]
Give me the exact amount and I'm ready to collect.

[2025-10-02 21:39] Brit: I'm just saying that it's unlikely you'll find someone who is looking for compensation to do that kind of work.

[2025-10-02 22:29] mtu: [replying to Brit: "this is not 50 usd kind of work in my opinion"]
Even the sheer number of acronyms mean it’s more than that, I charge a flat fee of $20/hour/acronym in the description

[2025-10-03 21:52] Windows2000Warrior**: Ok i can pay 200$ , who is intersted ?

[2025-10-04 00:28] the horse: an indian on upwork

[2025-10-04 09:53] Windows2000Warrior**: many people use our server iso for newer hardware , so the matter is serious : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVGUtt7YtxI

Can Windows 2000 really run on a modern Ryzen 9 9900X system with a Gen 5 NVMe SSD? Let's find out! Along the way, I moved the whole setup AM5 setup into a new DarkFlash DY451L PRO case, paired it wit

[2025-10-04 16:18] iPower: [replying to Windows2000Warrior**: "many people use our server iso for newer hardware ..."]
then offer the proper compensation.

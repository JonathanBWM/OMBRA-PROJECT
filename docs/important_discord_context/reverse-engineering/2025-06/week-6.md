[2025-06-30 14:54] Matti: [replying to eternablue: "😂"]
FWIW I also tried and failed to reproduce your issue (using 10.0.26100.0 though)

[2025-06-30 14:54] Matti: sad because I wanted to be able to blame IDA's pdb plugin for something as usual

[2025-06-30 14:54] Pepsi: [replying to Lasagne: ""]
he is trying to say that latest ida was leaked <@542033227192336394> , without saying it

[2025-06-30 14:57] Lasagne: [replying to Pepsi: "he is trying to say that latest ida was leaked <@5..."]

[2025-06-30 14:57] Lasagne: you dont want to see the rest of this conversation it went left so fast

[2025-06-30 14:58] Pepsi: can I see the video? <:topkek:904522829616263178>

[2025-06-30 14:58] Lasagne: [replying to Pepsi: "can I see the video? <:topkek:904522829616263178>"]
sadly that offer was declined, however we discussed favourite onion types and how we use them

[2025-06-30 14:59] Lasagne: still if any takers are keen my dms are open

[2025-06-30 15:01] eternablue: in case u wanna check

[2025-06-30 15:06] Matti: hahaha

[2025-06-30 15:06] Matti: yes, reproduces

[2025-06-30 15:06] Matti: only if using the original pdb plugin

[2025-06-30 15:06] Matti: as expected

[2025-06-30 15:08] Matti: this is why I still have my own fork of the pdb plugin from the IDA SDK, even in 9.1

[2025-06-30 15:09] Matti: because IDA replaced the MS DIA based one with their own broken parser in 7.2(?)

[2025-06-30 15:12] Matti: in theory changing `PDB_PROVIDER = PDB_PROVIDER_PDBIDA` to `PDB_PROVIDER = PDB_PROVIDER_MSDIA` in pdb.cfg should suffice to fix this, but for some reason on my system it does not

[2025-06-30 15:13] Matti: 7.7 is so old by now there could be a lot of reasons for that that I'm not super interested in debugging

[2025-06-30 15:17] Pepsi: [replying to Lasagne: "still if any takers are keen my dms are open"]

[2025-06-30 15:17] Lasagne: technically not illegal

[2025-06-30 15:18] magicbyte: [replying to Pepsi: "to exchange opinions on your favorite types of oni..."]

[2025-06-30 15:18] Pepsi: what the...

[2025-06-30 15:19] Lasagne: its been  a rough 35 minutes

[2025-06-30 15:21] Matti: [replying to Pepsi: "to exchange opinions on your favorite types of oni..."]
I know the new onion is the same good shit, but I really prefered the old name

[2025-06-30 15:22] Matti: fckilfk just had something about it

[2025-06-30 15:22] Matti: almost like it was trying to say something

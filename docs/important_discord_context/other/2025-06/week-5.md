fortnite got rid of BE? finally

[2025-06-23 14:38] iPower: [replying to pinefin: "fortnite got rid of BE? finally"]
long time ago

[2025-06-23 14:39] iPower: they even have their own "anti-tamper"

[2025-06-23 14:39] iPower: which is integrated into EAC

[2025-06-23 14:39] pinefin: [replying to iPower: "they even have their own "anti-tamper""]
oh neat. yeah i guess ive just not been in the 'scene' recently to notice this

[2025-06-23 14:40] iPower: yeah it was like a year ago that BE got dropped

[2025-06-23 14:43] iPower: as someone who develops third-party services for games, im glad BE got dropped

[2025-06-23 14:43] iPower: their detections only hurt legit products, not actual cheats

[2025-06-23 14:43] iPower: BE can rot in hell 👍

[2025-06-23 19:00] codeneverdies: [replying to iPower: "they even have their own "anti-tamper""]
Is that something like hyperion from roblox?

[2025-06-23 19:02] iPower: [replying to codeneverdies: "Is that something like hyperion from roblox?"]
sort of. its not really an anti-tamper. only has the page encryption memes (there might be other features but i only care about having a "clean" binary)

[2025-06-23 19:03] iPower: but its just easier for me to call it an "anti-tamper" because people will associate it with hyperion

[2025-06-23 19:04] iPower: or i guess you can call it, idk. "anti-tamper" is being used for a lot of different stuff nowadays

its also anti-hwid

[2025-06-23 21:26] sync: not sure if you're talking about UAC or not

are you the man behind overwolf or something? 🤔

[2025-06-23 21:31] pinefin: (id hope not, that thing is adware/bloatware)

[2025-06-23 21:44] pinefin: -# we can take this off-topic if needed btw, just wondering what BE could be messing with. i know overwolf loads a dll into the game

[2025-06-24 00:25] iPower: [replying to sync: "not sure if you're talking about UAC or not"]
nope, talking about EAC

[2025-06-24 00:25] iPower: [replying to pinefin: "are you the man behind overwolf or something? 🤔"]
nope

[2025-06-24 00:26] iPower: [replying to pinefin: "-# we can take this off-topic if needed btw, just ..."]
some shellcode had very specific detections for unreal engine

[2025-06-24 00:27] iPower: but in reality most people werent even getting caught by it because they didnt even need to use it

[2025-06-24 02:03] sync: [replying to iPower: "nope, talking about EAC"]
ah yeh

[2025-06-24 03:40] selfprxvoked: [replying to pinefin: "are you the man behind overwolf or something? 🤔"]

so how are you using "anti-tamper" in this context?

[2025-06-24 03:43] selfprxvoked: [replying to iPower: "sort of. its not really an anti-tamper. only has t..."]
anti-tampers are like packers that only decrypts executable memory during execution?

[2025-06-24 03:44] iPower: no, but thats what people call it nowadays

[2025-06-24 03:44] iPower: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[2025-06-24 03:46] selfprxvoked: so what exactly an anti-tamper should do to be classified as an anti-tamper other than encrypting executable sections?

[2025-06-24 03:48] iPower: literally do more than that

[2025-06-24 03:48] iPower: page encryption memes are trivial to solve

[2025-06-24 03:48] iPower: i dont consider that an anti-tamper because at the end its still easily solvable

[2025-06-24 03:48] selfprxvoked: integrity checks, anti-hooking and other stuffs are just trivial anti-cheat methods am I wrong?

[2025-06-24 03:49] iPower: [replying to selfprxvoked: "integrity checks, anti-hooking and other stuffs ar..."]
those can be considered as anti-tamper as well

[2025-06-24 03:49] iPower: but what im saying is that people call page encryption "anti-tampering"

[2025-06-24 03:49] selfprxvoked: yeah, thats why I don't get it why people are separating anti-cheats from anti-tampers

[2025-06-24 03:49] selfprxvoked: [replying to iPower: "but what im saying is that people call page encryp..."]
got it

[2025-06-24 03:49] iPower: well in a sense both employ the same techniques

[2025-06-24 03:52] selfprxvoked: I'm just trying to understand why aren't anti-cheats classifieds as anti-tampers and vice-versa since they have the same objectives and employ the same techniques

[2025-06-24 03:52] iPower: never said an anti-cheat can't be an anti-tamper

[2025-06-24 03:52] selfprxvoked: nah, sorry, I'm not saying you said any of that

[2025-06-24 03:53] iPower: but imo a true anti-tamper should make having a runnable copy (with patches as well) as hard as possible

[2025-06-24 03:54] iPower: page encryption isn't going to achieve that

[2025-06-24 03:55] selfprxvoked: anti-cheats devs* are now writing that down to start developing in the future 👀

[2025-06-24 03:55] iPower: i still dont get why EAC added page encryption to fortnite. that didnt solve anything, and even their implementation is weak

[2025-06-24 03:56] iPower: the weakest one so far

[2025-06-24 03:56] selfprxvoked: it justs sounds like a packer with extra steps tbh

[2025-06-24 03:59] selfprxvoked: [replying to iPower: "the weakest one so far"]
is Hyperion doing something better than that at least? since people claims it to be an anti-tamper as well

[2025-06-24 04:00] iPower: [replying to selfprxvoked: "I'm just trying to understand why aren't anti-chea..."]
but I'd say it really depends on what is the goal, and what is currently implemented. some anti-cheats i dont even consider as anti-cheats because they are pretty useless

[2025-06-24 04:00] selfprxvoked: idk anything about it because it is Roblox-related iirc

[2025-06-24 04:00] iPower: neither do i my friend. do i look like someone that cares about roblox

[2025-06-24 04:01] selfprxvoked: right

[2025-06-24 04:01] iPower: but yeah hyperion still had better memes when fortnite was using it

[2025-06-24 04:01] selfprxvoked: I could've asked if you've touched it* from the third-party services you said you do mb

[2025-06-24 04:02] iPower: like fake pages that would trigger special conditions

[2025-06-24 04:03] selfprxvoked: interesting

[2025-06-24 04:03] iPower: from what i heard hyperion implements some sort of nanomites now, but i cant confirm anything since i didnt touch the roblox version

[2025-06-24 04:03] iPower: and i honestly dont care

[2025-06-24 04:03] selfprxvoked: an advanced page protection meme 💀

[2025-06-24 04:04] iPower: [replying to selfprxvoked: "an advanced page protection meme 💀"]
eh i wouldnt say advanced because it was still solvable

[2025-06-24 04:04] selfprxvoked: [replying to iPower: "from what i heard hyperion implements some sort of..."]
nanomites was the name I was trying to remember I even looked for "nanites" in Google lol <:skill_issue:1210171860063617074>

[2025-06-24 04:05] JustMagic: [replying to iPower: "from what i heard hyperion implements some sort of..."]
that existed from the beginning of hyperion

[2025-06-24 04:05] iPower: oh interesting i didnt know

[2025-06-24 04:05] selfprxvoked: I thought the page protection meme EAC implemented was actually nanomites lol

[2025-06-24 04:06] iPower: at the time i worked on fortnite i didnt really need a runnable binary so all i cared about was the page encryption memes

[2025-06-24 04:06] iPower: [replying to selfprxvoked: "I thought the page protection meme EAC implemented..."]
no

[2025-06-24 04:06] selfprxvoked: and how does that doesn't hurt performance

[2025-06-24 04:07] selfprxvoked: it would need to be heavily optimized leaving hot paths decrypted and using some sort of PGO to do it effectively ig

[2025-06-24 04:10] JustMagic: [replying to selfprxvoked: "it would need to be heavily optimized leaving hot ..."]
I don't think anyone's doing anything fancy like that

[2025-06-24 04:13] iPower: [replying to selfprxvoked: "I thought the page protection meme EAC implemented..."]
what EAC implemented (at least for what i cared about) was page encryption memes and relocation of the binary

[2025-06-24 04:13] iPower: the first version even had encryption for .rdata but then it was removed. same about relocation

[2025-06-24 04:14] iPower: the relocation meme was really just allocating extra space in the binary and relocating it at runtime, including the PE headers

[2025-06-24 04:16] iPower: the page encryption stuff got improved a bit. using random gadgets won't really work and they also have some checks for execution in random addresses. but nothing really hard

[2025-06-24 04:17] iPower: for hyperion i had to call their decryption routine directly. for EAC touching the manually mapped dll isn't even needed

[2025-06-24 04:17] JustMagic: inlining on clang do be a fuck

[2025-06-24 04:18] selfprxvoked: [replying to JustMagic: "inlining on clang do be a fuck"]
is that related to the inline syscall lib?

[2025-06-24 04:18] iPower: oh yeah i believe everything is inlined now. but at the time i was lucky to have a routine to call

[2025-06-24 04:18] iPower: as long as i didnt pass RVA of a trap page

[2025-06-24 04:18] selfprxvoked: nah lol

[2025-06-24 04:18] JustMagic: [replying to selfprxvoked: "is that related to the inline syscall lib?"]
hmm? hyperion never used the inline syscalls lib

[2025-06-24 04:18] iPower: which was still in a list iirc. i heard those are inlined as well

[2025-06-24 04:19] iPower: (trap pages rvas/indexes)

[2025-06-24 04:19] selfprxvoked: [replying to JustMagic: "hmm? hyperion never used the inline syscalls lib"]
nah forget it I just remembered something about clang ang GCC inline assembly in your inline syscalls lib, forget it about it

[2025-06-24 04:19] iPower: id say the only good part of EAC adding page encryption memes is really recording exception information

[2025-06-24 04:20] iPower: thats the """scariest""" part ive seen so far

[2025-06-24 04:20] selfprxvoked: [replying to iPower: "oh yeah i believe everything is inlined now. but a..."]
I'd expect them to be inlining alot of stuff from the beginning tho

[2025-06-24 04:21] JustMagic: [replying to selfprxvoked: "nah forget it I just remembered something about cl..."]
I was refering to the fact that in general inlining in clang is a bit of a mess

Oh okay got it

[2025-06-24 04:21] JustMagic: that's kind of the reason hyperion for a while had a bunch of non-inlined shit

[2025-06-24 04:21] selfprxvoked: did you ever tried MSVC tho?

[2025-06-24 04:21] JustMagic: nah lol

[2025-06-24 04:22] selfprxvoked: inlining in there without a special compiler flag it is just impossible

[2025-06-24 04:22] iPower: [replying to JustMagic: "that's kind of the reason hyperion for a while had..."]
yeah i heard you guys are inlining even the trap pages indexes now right

[2025-06-24 04:22] iPower: because at the time you could pattern match to find the list

[2025-06-24 04:22] iPower: which was what i did

[2025-06-24 04:22] JustMagic: [replying to iPower: "yeah i heard you guys are inlining even the trap p..."]
yeah, but it was more a trouble with bigger functions

[2025-06-24 04:22] selfprxvoked: how is that?

[2025-06-24 04:23] selfprxvoked: it was increasing compiler time too much or it was just crashing the compiler right away? <:topkek:904522829616263178>

[2025-06-24 04:23] JustMagic: clang will refuse to inline functions with different eh personalities across compilation units

[2025-06-24 04:23] selfprxvoked: lol

[2025-06-24 04:23] JustMagic: [replying to selfprxvoked: "it was increasing compiler time too much or it was..."]
we had clang patches for that day 1

[2025-06-24 04:23] JustMagic: (not crashes, but making it faster)

[2025-06-24 04:24] selfprxvoked: template metaprogramming goes woof

[2025-06-24 04:24] JustMagic: [replying to JustMagic: "clang will refuse to inline functions with differe..."]
basically if you mark a function a function `always_inline` you expect it to be inlined even if it's not defined in the header.

[2025-06-24 04:24] JustMagic: but that does not happen if the eh personality of the caller doesn't match its own

[2025-06-24 04:25] JustMagic: eh personality being whether it uses `__try` `__except` inside of itself

[2025-06-24 04:25] selfprxvoked: yeah you can't inline functions that has SEH tho

[2025-06-24 04:25] selfprxvoked: at least from what I remember

[2025-06-24 04:26] selfprxvoked: from MSVC

[2025-06-24 04:26] JustMagic: they get inlined perfectly fine, just not across CUs

[2025-06-24 04:26] selfprxvoked: and probably Clang would try to have compatibility with it to compile on Windows

[2025-06-24 04:27] selfprxvoked: [replying to JustMagic: "they get inlined perfectly fine, just not across C..."]
they do? I really remember reading something that MSVC did not accept `__forceinline` when SEH was being used

[2025-06-24 04:27] JustMagic: 🤷‍♂️

[2025-06-24 04:28] selfprxvoked: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-4-c4714

[2025-06-24 04:28] selfprxvoked: yeah, it is not exactly the function itself

[2025-06-24 04:28] selfprxvoked: only if it mixes them

[2025-06-24 04:29] selfprxvoked: the C++ EH and SEH

[2025-06-24 04:29] iPower: [replying to selfprxvoked: "from MSVC"]
rule number 1 is never use MSVC

[2025-06-24 04:29] iPower: if you dont want to suffer

[2025-06-24 04:30] selfprxvoked: [replying to iPower: "rule number 1 is never use MSVC"]
yeah from game devs perspective it is better to use all compilers actually

[2025-06-24 04:30] selfprxvoked: at least the major ones

[2025-06-24 04:30] selfprxvoked: because of the warnings you got across different compilers can be really helpful

[2025-06-24 04:30] iPower: not even saying from a game development perspective. just saying that if you dont want something that outputs trash you have to avoid it

[2025-06-24 04:31] selfprxvoked: yeah I don't use MSVC anymore at least a year now, but I still use their warnings

[2025-06-24 04:32] JustMagic: [replying to iPower: "not even saying from a game development perspectiv..."]
I've been gaslit enough by an ex MSVC dev to believe that LLVM+LTO+PGO > MSVC+LTO+PGO > LLVM+LTO > MSVC+LTO > LLVM+thin LTO performance wise

[2025-06-24 04:33] selfprxvoked: for performance reasons LLVM it is way better than MSVC

[2025-06-24 04:33] JustMagic: [replying to selfprxvoked: "for performance reasons LLVM it is way better than..."]
not the case if you don't use full lto, which is harder than on MSVC

[2025-06-24 04:33] selfprxvoked: MSVC has a lot of problems with SIMD optimizations

[2025-06-24 04:36] selfprxvoked: the good thing MSVC has for me during development process it is their Unity building which I don't know if LLVM has it

[2025-06-24 04:36] selfprxvoked: without configuring an entire build system with modularity

[2025-06-24 04:36] selfprxvoked: but anyway

[2025-06-24 04:55] Lyssa: i thought unity used llvm for il2cpp compilation?

[2025-06-24 04:56] Lyssa: or are you talking about something else

[2025-06-24 17:58] jay: why is every game unbanning people nowadays

[2025-06-24 17:58] jay: is it a data issue ?

[2025-06-24 18:08] dagger: if ur talking about fortnite probably because they lost an abudance of players by having really bad updates and just unbanned most of the userbase in hopes they return without cheating

[2025-06-26 04:58] Wall-ET: Hey guys, has anyone ever seen a pattern like this in AC before?

I’m working on a privilege escalation bug and found an AC that looks vulnerable, but it’s been really tough to debug.  It seems like there are literally no sanity checks on their ioctl calls, and they’re doing some privileged shit, but what I’m seeing at runtime is totally different. My IOCTLs aren’t getting triggered, and my breakpoints aren’t hitting. I even tried patching the IAT to block calls to functions like nt!KdChangeOption, nt!KdDebuggerEnabled, and nt!KdDisableDebugger, but for some reason WinDbg still doesn’t break where I want it to.


Is this normal behavior?

[2025-06-26 05:27] UJ: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22830

[2025-06-26 05:27] UJ: reminds me of that

[2025-06-26 05:30] daax: [replying to Wall-ET: "Hey guys, has anyone ever seen a pattern like this..."]
is this ricochet (randgrid/atvi driver)? i.e. the king of occupying debug registers? For the first part, I would start with verifying that the major function handlers were not modified after loading or use !drvobj to verify the tables, as for the second, could be a number of things and speculation wouldn’t really wouldn’t be much assistance without more information about what else you’ve tried. Is there anything higher on the device stack? Did you look at kdptrap/kdtrap or kdpdebugroutineselect, haltscquerycounterordered, etc?

[2025-06-26 05:32] Wall-ET: [replying to UJ: "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22830"]

I got a breakpoint at the end of the driver initialization, so pretty much everything has executed by this point. The drvobj doesn’t show any changes to the major functions, but for some reason, my IOCTL doesn’t trigger IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL (It doesn't hit my breakpoint)

I was guessing this might be because of the Kd debugger-related functions I’m patching. Maybe WinDbg isn’t working properly, but since I’m patching at the IAT, it shouldn’t interfere, right?

[2025-06-26 06:23] Wall-ET: Damn, I wasn’t verifying my IOCTL output. I’m getting "A device attached to the system is not functioning", the driver is corrupted...

Spent way too much time debugging, thinking it was an anti-debugging trick ;c

you can just google this (unless you literally want to know what the abbreviation stands for... control flow guard)
MSDN will describe all of this in detail

[2025-06-26 14:11] daax: [replying to 0xboga: "Anyone familiar with CFG? What’s _guard_fids_table..."]
yes. stores rvas of expected indirect call targets. yes, they are explicitly marked as valid targets for indirect calls; the table is built during compilation. if you want to modify a binary or relocate items with cfg you will need to rebuild the table.

[2025-06-26 14:13] daax: as matti said, this is all documented on msdn or other blogs. including the ntsetinformationvirtualmemory to add exceptions to the cfg.

<@123674330256113664>

[2025-06-28 16:57] magicbyte: when hooking directx11, a common initial starting point is to retrieve the existing ID3D11Device COM object and traverse the interface's vtable to find other d3d11 functions that are not exposed as an export in the dlls. to achieve this you make a call to D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain to create a dummy device, which rather than creating a new device returns an existing one to a user defined pointer. however, this involves calling D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain (export of d3d11.dll) which could be hooked or the function call could be traced in many ways. since microsoft publishes pdbs for d3d11 libraries, wouldn't it be more stealthier to parse the pdb and find the functions in the library based on the pdb?

[2025-06-28 17:32] daax: i’m not following how you arrived at the use of pdbs being stealthier. are you implying that you’d try to find the actual swapchain instance without calling functions?

[2025-06-28 17:33] magicbyte: yeah

[2025-06-28 17:33] magicbyte: directly finding the function with the usage of the pdb rather than calling the export D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain to create a dummy device and retrieve the interface

[2025-06-28 17:33] magicbyte: which contains the vftable of the functions

[2025-06-28 17:33] daax: [replying to magicbyte: "yeah"]
and then once you find it what’s your plan? grab vtable and hook present?

[2025-06-28 17:34] magicbyte: exactly

[2025-06-28 17:34] magicbyte: the end goal would be to hook present

[2025-06-28 17:35] daax: [replying to magicbyte: "the end goal would be to hook present"]
okay, so, why do you believe that would that be stealthier given most modern anti-cheats have hooks in all throughout those functions?

[2025-06-28 17:35] daax: you would validate this of course but they tend* to place hooks at various depths in these dx functions.

[2025-06-28 17:36] magicbyte: right, but i'd ideally overwrite their hooks with mine given that they are located at the function prologue

[2025-06-28 17:37] daax: [replying to magicbyte: "right, but i'd ideally overwrite their hooks with ..."]
and if their hooks track frame rate among other things?

[2025-06-28 17:38] magicbyte: could you elaborate how tracking frame rate would go like? do you mean by counting and incrementing a frame counter?

[2025-06-28 17:38] daax: [replying to magicbyte: "could you elaborate how tracking frame rate would ..."]
i’m just giving you hypotheticals because using pdbs to find the same information you’d use otherwise doesn’t mitigate detectability

[2025-06-28 17:39] magicbyte: right, but I am avoiding calling a foothold function that most people do

[2025-06-28 17:39] daax: tailoring your acquisition and hooks to the anticheats implementation is the only way to mitigate detectability to some degree

[2025-06-28 17:39] magicbyte: so it must be stealthier if I just directly locate the functions, at least in theory

[2025-06-28 17:39] daax: [replying to magicbyte: "right, but I am avoiding calling a foothold functi..."]
sure but then you still hook present is my point

[2025-06-28 17:39] magicbyte: yeah

[2025-06-28 17:39] magicbyte: from that point it's the same

[2025-06-28 17:39] koyz: you don't even really need to call any functions to get a valid/ already created swapchain?

[2025-06-28 17:40] magicbyte: you can not locate COM objects throughout the Win API

[2025-06-28 17:40] magicbyte: and pattern scanning is just retarded

[2025-06-28 17:40] daax: and none of that previous effort matters if you just nuke their hook without understanding it. call it or not the pdbs to improve stealth is my point. you can certainly use them but <:PES2_Shrug:513352546341879808> it doesn’t reduce the effort to hide

[2025-06-28 17:40] magicbyte: fair enough

[2025-06-28 17:40] koyz: [replying to magicbyte: "and pattern scanning is just retarded"]
but it does the job? using the info you want to attain is the difficult thing here, not finding it lol

[2025-06-28 17:41] magicbyte: would you rather write code that will forever find the right function for you, or write code that you continously have to change by updating signatures?

[2025-06-28 17:41] magicbyte: not to mention that scanning process memory is so easily detectable

[2025-06-28 17:43] daax: i think my point was lost: using pdbs won’t improve your stealthiness. you’re essentially entering a building only to break the same window as you would have if you went through the front door. + other artifacts of pdb processing being visible in the games address space.

[2025-06-28 17:44] magicbyte: oh yeah I was replying to <@229977096078753793>'s suggestion of signatures

[2025-06-28 17:44] daax: [replying to magicbyte: "oh yeah I was replying to <@229977096078753793>'s ..."]
ah i see

[2025-06-28 17:44] magicbyte: however, great analogy and I would argue that by avoiding the front door I still am more stealthier compared to walking in

[2025-06-28 17:45] magicbyte: I get that the main detection vector would be the hooking of the actual functions not the retrieval of them

[2025-06-28 17:45] magicbyte: I can't argue with that

funny that I was wondering how to deal with this very problem when I wrote efiguard and we clearly strongly disagree on whether using PDBs is the most dependable long term solution

[2025-06-28 22:20] Matti: FWIW, the first commit of efiguard worked on every version of windows released after that for 5 years

[2025-06-28 22:20] Matti: so that's pretty long, but not eternal

[2025-06-28 22:21] Matti: though the change I had to make to fix the change MS made was more of an oversight in retrospect that I could have foreseen

[2025-06-28 22:22] diversenok: Downloading PDBs on the spot decisively fails the test for bringing unnecessary dependencies

[2025-06-28 22:22] Matti: I know there are too many publicly released versions of ntoskrnl.exe that simply don't have a PDB available on the MS server at all

[2025-06-28 22:23] Matti: yeah that as well, downloaidng PDBs in EFI would at best only ever be an extremely convoluted fallback solution

[2025-06-28 22:24] Matti: but I still considered them as serious alternative in my head just to try and find flaws in the plan I went with in the end

[2025-06-28 22:25] Matti: also, efiguard was originally a different (user mode) project that simply patched files and wrote them to disk because fuck the police

[2025-06-28 22:25] Matti: I absolutely could have used PDBs in that project but I still went with the pattern scanning (~40%) + dissasembler (~60%) in the end

[2025-06-28 22:27] Matti: I think one reason you are coming to (IMO) the wrong conclusion here <@1355124698874249316> is that too many people think you can write an effective pattern to scan for by looking at one sample file

[2025-06-28 22:28] Matti: in fact what I did was collect all ntoskrnl releases since vista (at least RTM ones) and ensure that every pattern worked on every release

[2025-06-28 22:29] Matti: the idea behind this being that if it worked for a long time in the past, it will probably continue to work for a long time into the future

[2025-06-29 09:29] magicbyte: [replying to Matti: "I think one reason you are coming to (IMO) the wro..."]
right, but you can never take signatures as granted

[2025-06-29 09:30] magicbyte: you can not make sure ever, that in a future update they won't change their code thus signature changes

[2025-06-29 09:30] magicbyte: on the other hand, using a pdb mitigates this. using a pdb gives you 100% success rate meanwhile we could hypotethically say patterns are 99.99%, but that's still not 100%.

[2025-06-29 09:30] Matti: I think you taking PDBs for granted is a much more serious mistake

[2025-06-29 09:30] magicbyte: why is that?

[2025-06-29 09:31] Matti: there absolutely are and continue to be binaries released for windows that will just 404 when you query their pdb

[2025-06-29 09:31] magicbyte: right, but I am not working with windows binariers

[2025-06-29 09:31] Matti: and when and for what files this happens is completely random

[2025-06-29 09:31] magicbyte: well, I am not even sure if d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll are maintaned by microsoft

[2025-06-29 09:32] magicbyte: let me check signatures

[2025-06-29 09:32] Matti: so you're not dependent on another party for your PDBs at all? i.e., you are considering how to find something in your own program?

[2025-06-29 09:32] Matti: right, I thought so

[2025-06-29 09:33] Matti: here
[Attachments: d3d11on12.dll]

[2025-06-29 09:33] magicbyte: they are signed by microsoft

[2025-06-29 09:34] magicbyte: well

[2025-06-29 09:34] Matti: obviously

[2025-06-29 09:34] magicbyte: there's an issue I encountered with pdbs though

[2025-06-29 09:34] magicbyte: [replying to Matti: "obviously"]
for some reason I thought directx was related to Nvidia

[2025-06-29 09:34] Matti: that does not imply that there will be a PDB for the file in any way

[2025-06-29 09:35] magicbyte: [replying to magicbyte: "there's an issue I encountered with pdbs though"]
which is the retrieval of virtual functions

[2025-06-29 09:35] magicbyte: normal functions I could find

[2025-06-29 09:35] magicbyte: but not virtual ones

[2025-06-29 09:35] magicbyte: not sure if that's me being a retard or extracting virtual functions from a pdb is not even possible?

[2025-06-29 09:35] Matti: yeah ok, so what I'm telling you is that the bigger issue is actually the retrieval of the PDBs

[2025-06-29 09:36] Matti: [replying to magicbyte: "not sure if that's me being a retard or extracting..."]
no clue

[2025-06-29 09:36] magicbyte: well, a simple query to a microsoft server is not too big of a hassle

[2025-06-29 09:36] Matti: <:lillullmoa:475778601141403648>

[2025-06-29 09:36] magicbyte: the fact that they may discontinue uploading it

[2025-06-29 09:36] magicbyte: is in fact a problem

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: they NEVER START uploading for some files

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: PDBs that exist, exist forever

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: on the MS server

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: with the one exception of that warbird pdb leak maybe

[2025-06-29 09:37] magicbyte: then why is retrieval an issue?

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: but not all binaries have a PDB in the first place

[2025-06-29 09:37] magicbyte: yes

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: [replying to magicbyte: "then why is retrieval an issue?"]
because

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: the file

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: may not

[2025-06-29 09:37] Matti: exist

[2025-06-29 09:38] Matti: how are you not following this

[2025-06-29 09:38] magicbyte: I literally don't understand how a file on my disk could disappear

[2025-06-29 09:38] magicbyte: what are you talking about it

[2025-06-29 09:38] Matti: ok good troll

[2025-06-29 09:39] magicbyte: you said they may discontinue the upload of future pdb files with which I agreed as an issue

[2025-06-29 09:40] Matti: no, that is not what I said

[2025-06-29 09:40] magicbyte: [replying to Matti: "that does not imply that there will be a PDB for t..."]
^

[2025-06-29 09:40] Matti: 'discontinue' implies there was ever a moment where the PDB was available

[2025-06-29 09:40] magicbyte: exactly

[2025-06-29 09:40] magicbyte: and it does exist right now

[2025-06-29 09:41] Matti: yes, did you see me use the word discontinue there? because I don't

[2025-06-29 09:41] magicbyte: or are you referring to pdbs in general rathern than scoping it down do d3d11.dll?

[2025-06-29 09:41] Matti: yes

[2025-06-29 09:41] Matti: holy fuck

[2025-06-29 09:41] magicbyte: oh yeah, I was talking about d3d11.dll specifically

[2025-06-29 09:41] Matti: obviously this problem applies to all pdbs

[2025-06-29 09:41] magicbyte: man, whatever, pdbs are shit either way

[2025-06-29 09:41] magicbyte: no virtual functions

[2025-06-29 09:41] Matti: [replying to magicbyte: "oh yeah, I was talking about d3d11.dll specificall..."]
note that the set of 'all pdbs' includes that

[2025-06-29 09:42] magicbyte: but I still won't reside to signatures

[2025-06-29 09:42] magicbyte: I'l ltry to scan memory for mangled names

[2025-06-29 09:42] magicbyte: and crawl back in the RTTI

[2025-06-29 09:42] magicbyte: to find the vftable

[2025-06-29 09:42] Matti: I'm not getting baited into writing aa PDB parser with DIA just to prove that you are misunderstanding yet another thing

[2025-06-29 09:42] magicbyte: don't

[2025-06-29 09:42] magicbyte: I tried and failed

[2025-06-29 09:42] magicbyte: lol

[2025-06-29 09:43] Matti: yeah, well if you already tried.... I guess I don't stand a chance

[2025-06-29 09:43] magicbyte: where did I imply that

[2025-06-29 09:44] magicbyte: I simply suggested not wasting your time by coding it

[2025-06-29 09:44] Matti: well great, then we are in agreement

[2025-06-29 09:45] Matti: but consider the possibility that you were simply Doing It Wrong

[2025-06-29 09:45] magicbyte: I do

[2025-06-29 09:45] magicbyte: I did not really spend much time fucking around with it

[2025-06-29 09:45] magicbyte: I just came to the conclusion that extracting and matching virtual functions is not a 5 minute project

[2025-06-29 09:45] magicbyte: and I don't wish to spend any more time on that

[2025-06-29 09:46] magicbyte: I'll see if mangled names work

[2025-06-29 17:13] magicbyte: <@148095953742725120> given that you try to memory scan a process which is running in user mode in order to find the right binary code, how would you mitigate the risks of avoiding a detection method which is based on reading the memory of a page which has only been reserved but not committed?

[2025-06-29 17:14] magicbyte: this was the other reason why I said I don't prefer pattern scanning and I am wondering what your view is on this

[2025-06-29 17:17] Brit: that seems like an extremely brittle detection method that would blow people up for having any number of AV products installed

[2025-06-29 17:18] magicbyte: COD games utilize such thing

[2025-06-29 17:18] magicbyte: or at least, they did in user-mode

[2025-06-29 17:19] Brit: not only them Blizz games have had the same trick in different forms with the working set watcher etc

[2025-06-29 17:20] magicbyte: sounds interesting, haven't seen any ACs mess with working sets

[2025-06-29 17:32] Brit: this is not the hard part

[2025-06-29 17:32] Oliver: [replying to magicbyte: "to avoid the potential future risks of being detec..."]
if you get detected by pattern scanning it was never going to be undetected either way

[2025-06-29 17:32] Brit: you are going to be facing a million more dt vectors with your rendering

[2025-06-29 17:33] magicbyte: do they check the frame buffers?

[2025-06-29 17:33] magicbyte: or compare it to something?

[2025-06-29 17:33] Brit: idk what you are touching so I cannot say

[2025-06-29 17:34] magicbyte: well, nothing yet, I am just trying to figure this out since it got my attention and I find this interesting

[2025-06-29 17:34] magicbyte: hence why I am here trying to ask experienced people about their opinions and experience

[2025-06-29 17:34] Oliver: i would just not draw on top of the game window  or same screen as the game and that should cover most of the head ache

[2025-06-29 17:35] Oliver: like a web radar or similar

[2025-06-29 17:37] magicbyte: but if I modify the front buffer that was about to be swapped with the current back buffer, or it's switched by hooking something like d3d11 present, there is no way of the process knowing that not the intended frame buffer was swapped unless they somehow compare it to something, right?

[2025-06-29 17:37] Brit: how are you synchronizing this

[2025-06-29 17:40] magicbyte: well, I am not sure if I'd have to syncrhonize anything, since I am just asking the API to modify some bytes in the existing back buffer then do the swap rather than letting the function do the swap as it normally would

[2025-06-29 17:40] Brit: how do you get present to not swap when it wants to but after you are done drawing your stuff to the buff

[2025-06-29 17:41] magicbyte: I put a call into the function prologue then return

[2025-06-29 17:42] Brit: yeah you are giga banned

[2025-06-29 17:43] Brit: you cannot just go around modifying the text sect

[2025-06-29 17:43] Oliver: [replying to Brit: "you cannot just go around modifying the text sect"]
make it rwx<:skill_issue:1210171860063617074>

[2025-06-29 17:43] magicbyte: that's true, but there are some other hooking techniques like making the CPU throw an exception on purpose then handle it

[2025-06-29 17:43] magicbyte: and so on

[2025-06-29 17:43] magicbyte: [replying to Oliver: "make it rwx<:skill_issue:1210171860063617074>"]
lol

[2025-06-29 17:44] magicbyte: not sure if hooking in today's world is even a possibility anymore?

[2025-06-29 17:44] brymko: [replying to Brit: "you cannot just go around modifying the text sect"]
There was this intel that TAC banned for inline hooks, I had inline hooks and never got banned

[2025-06-29 17:44] magicbyte: oh yeah I read about that as well

Back in the pubg days be only checked the first i don't remember but like 1024 bytes of the signed loaded dlls you could just stomp over the rest for free

[2025-06-29 17:47] brymko: Dunno if that was the case, but that was on like the usual hook everyone placed

[2025-06-29 17:47] brymko: and everyone was like this shit detected af

[2025-06-29 17:47] brymko: I didn't hook the prologue but deeper into the function

[2025-06-29 17:47] brymko: maybe that's what saved me idk

[2025-06-29 17:48] brymko: but idk what they did on the detect side

[2025-06-29 17:49] magicbyte: weren't they only detecting API hooks?

I’ve been reversing Black Ops Cold War for a while now, and I’ve finally decided to share my res

[2025-06-29 17:49] magicbyte: great article

[2025-06-29 17:49] magicbyte: he only mentions API hooking but not .text or anything like that

[2025-06-29 17:51] magicbyte: also since we were discussing virtual functions, instead of modifying the function in .text, you could pointer swap the vftable in .rdata

[2025-06-29 17:55] Oliver: [replying to magicbyte: "https://ssno.cc/posts/reversing-tac-1-4-2025/"]
just scrolled through and my initial thought is that usermode ac has been the same for too long

[2025-06-29 17:56] magicbyte: well, they now use Ricochet which is kernel mode

[2025-06-29 17:57] magicbyte: so this really isn't relevant anymore, but interesting to see nonetheless

[2025-06-29 18:18] the horse: as daax mentioned your issue still falls on deep hooks rather than someone swapping the EAT entry

[2025-06-29 18:19] the horse: there's funny remapping memes to avoid this but it comes with its own caveats

[2025-06-29 18:27] magicbyte: I see

[2025-06-29 18:29] magicbyte: do people render shit throughout kernel mode?

[2025-06-29 18:29] magicbyte: isn't fucking with the GPU drivers considered too complicated?

[2025-06-29 18:31] magicbyte: By the way, I googled all of the questions that I ask/asked and I could not find any proper answers, hence why I am asking it

[2025-06-29 20:09] selfprxvoked: [replying to Oliver: "ye, i guess a cache side channel could be stronger..."]
Wouldn't that alert AVs about side channel attacks?

[2025-06-29 20:13] selfprxvoked: don't know if any AV is trying to detect it tho, since it is pretty unreliable

[2025-06-29 20:24] 0xboga: When a certificate is “revoked” (say it was leaked) 
Will it fail to pass DSE checks or is it blocked by the MSFT driver blocklist?

[2025-06-29 20:25] 0xboga: And how do certs get leaked anyway?

[2025-06-29 20:38] selfprxvoked: [replying to 0xboga: "And how do certs get leaked anyway?"]
Normally they get leaked by breaches

[2025-06-29 20:53] Matti: [replying to 0xboga: "When a certificate is “revoked” (say it was leaked..."]
from the last time I tried this I seem to remember that a driver with a revoked cert will actually be loaded fine, even though the file properties dialog will clearly show it is revoked

[2025-06-29 20:54] Matti: my guess is that revocvation checks are/were deemed tpo expensive to run on each binary (mainly querying CRLs which can just fail or block indefinitely)

[2025-06-29 20:55] Matti: I've got a vulnerable vbox driver from 2008 that I could swear was explicitly revoked (because it was used in turla and the original DSE) that you could use to try this

[2025-06-29 20:56] Matti: it is on the banned driver blacklist too, so you'd need to disable that check to eliminate that as the cause of any load failure

[2025-06-29 20:57] Matti: Hm, it looks like that file might've been a virus. Instead of cooking up trouble, try cooking up a Beet-Pickled Deviled Eggs: <https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-beet-pickled-deviled-eggs-151550>

my memory came back to me and the story actually goes like this: I obtained this driver file and found out to my amazement that its cert was not revoked, despite turla and DSE
so I wrote a little batch script that will manually add it to the Disallowed store in windows
you need to run `install-banned-cert-LM-GPO.cmd` and then reboot in order to get this to show

[2025-06-29 21:32] Matti: this isn't the same thing as the *issuer* explicitly revoking the cert, but they end up in the same store and by my logic there should be no difference in behaviour wrt who put a certificate in this store

[2025-06-29 21:33] Matti: that's why the batch file requires admin rights, because it uses group policy to put it there machine wide

[2025-06-29 21:33] Matti: still, if anyone has a driver with a cert that was actually explicitly revoked by the issuer, feel free to share so we can be sure it makes no difference

[2025-06-29 21:37] Matti: these are the results on server 2025 with the blocklist disabled
[Attachments: image.png]

[2025-06-29 21:38] Matti: so, my hypothesis is that driver loading still does not involve revocation checks in any way, and that MS now relies on the driver blacklist to block particularly notorious drivers

[2025-06-29 21:41] Matti: back when I wrote this there was no such thing as a vulnerable driver list, so I was pretty baffled that (1) the cert was not revoked and (2) manually revoking the cert with the highest possible privileges did not make any difference

I looked into it before

[2025-06-30 03:34] JustMagic: the theme that his site is/was based seems to have created the similar design elements at roughly the same time our website got them

Re: your amazement - I know it didn’t use to matter if you revoked the certificate, so some vendors didn’t care to revoke it. When kdmapper came out, I tried for a bit to get it revoked, but revoking it didn’t do anything and Msft at the time had no plans to make it do anything. So I gave up.
We should ask one of the driver cheat devs to revoke an old sys and try it out

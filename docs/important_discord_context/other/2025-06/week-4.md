[2025-06-18 21:29] iris: oh brother

[2025-06-18 23:08] dagger: anyone know how to figure out the anticheat that games use? ive done some research but im not sure and in the long run i just wanted to know if theres a good way to figure out an anticheat a videogame uses besides searching because sometimes searching doesnt give good results or the game is too unknown and sometimes the game itself doesnt show what anticheat is used
that might be a stupid question but all help is welcome

[2025-06-18 23:19] toasts: you can look if there are any newly created drivers or services on game launch for a quick win

[2025-06-18 23:19] dagger: yeah usually i check in task manager and usually its there just putting this question out incase yk

[2025-06-18 23:19] dagger: idk if there are any games that try to hide it

[2025-06-18 23:19] toasts: use systeminformer

[2025-06-18 23:20] dagger: alright ill download it

[2025-06-18 23:20] dagger: what does it do?

[2025-06-18 23:21] toasts: it’ll make it easier to spot the newly created ac service or driver (assuming it isn’t baked into the game itself)

[2025-06-18 23:21] dagger: ah ok

[2025-06-18 23:21] dagger: [replying to toasts: "it’ll make it easier to spot the newly created ac ..."]
if this was the case, game had a built in anticheat made by the same devs of the game what would be the best way to approach the situation

[2025-06-18 23:29] diversenok: [replying to dagger: "what does it do?"]
It's a much more powerful version of a task manager

[2025-06-18 23:30] dagger: [replying to diversenok: "It's a much more powerful version of a task manage..."]
haha yeah i noticed it can freeze stuff thats cool

[2025-06-18 23:31] diversenok: You want to be looking at the services tab for services and drivers that are not from Microsoft

[2025-06-18 23:31] diversenok: Especially if they start alongside the game

[2025-06-18 23:33] diversenok: You can also enable notifications for new/started services under the main menu -> View -> Tray icons -> Notifications

[2025-06-19 00:21] iPower: [replying to dagger: "anyone know how to figure out the anticheat that g..."]
i usually just check the game directory

[2025-06-19 00:21] iPower: and loaded drivers/services/dlls

[2025-06-19 00:21] iPower: steamdb.info also puts the AC there when its known

[2025-06-19 00:22] dagger: [replying to iPower: "steamdb.info also puts the AC there when its known"]
thanks! i didnt know steamdb had this info

[2025-06-19 00:22] iPower: yep its pretty useful for lazy people like me heh

[2025-06-19 00:22] iPower: 
[Attachments: image.png]

[2025-06-19 00:23] dagger: ohh nice

[2025-06-19 00:23] dagger: but siege x has shield guard

[2025-06-19 00:23] iPower: i dont even know what shield guard is. is it proprietary?

[2025-06-19 00:23] dagger: yea it was made by the devs of siege

[2025-06-19 00:23] dagger: 
[Attachments: image.png]

[2025-06-19 00:23] dagger: also i dont know why vac isnt shown here

[2025-06-19 00:24] iPower: [replying to dagger: "yea it was made by the devs of siege"]
mmmm yeah makes sense steamdb only puts whats known

[2025-06-19 00:24] iPower: [replying to dagger: "also i dont know why vac isnt shown here"]
great question

[2025-06-19 00:24] dagger: xd

[2025-06-19 00:24] dagger: they did a video on shieldguard

[2025-06-19 00:24] dagger: it goes of f files tho

[2025-06-19 00:24] dagger: i think its built into the engine they use im not entirely sure

[2025-06-19 00:24] iPower: interesting didnt even know it was a thing

[2025-06-19 00:25] dagger: yeah i was trying to figure out what siege x uses now

[2025-06-19 00:25] dagger: im not sure if they use both BE and shieldguard

[2025-06-19 00:25] dagger: or only shieldguard now

[2025-06-19 00:25] iPower: pretty sure they still use BE

[2025-06-19 00:25] iPower: its probably the same case as fortnite

[2025-06-19 00:25] iPower: it uses EAC and UAC, their internal ac

[2025-06-19 00:26] dagger: uac?

[2025-06-19 00:26] dagger: thats alot of anti cheats

[2025-06-19 00:26] dagger: because im wondering if u had to make a cheat for said game how would you? would u need a driver that bypasses all anticheats

[2025-06-19 00:26] iPower: yeah its their own anti-cheat. UAC means User Anti-Cheat iirc

[2025-06-19 00:26] dagger: ooh

[2025-06-19 00:27] iPower: [replying to dagger: "because im wondering if u had to make a cheat for ..."]
when i used to cheat in games i usually attacked the anti-cheats directly

[2025-06-19 00:27] dagger: and about siege i wouldnt want anybody making a battleye driver just for it to not be there anymore lol

[2025-06-19 00:27] dagger: oh and then u would make ur cheat?

[2025-06-19 00:27] dagger: ive seen that most people write the bypasses before the cheat itself

[2025-06-19 00:27] iPower: i didnt try to make my solution generic. and its actually pretty hard to make a "work for all" solution. requires a lot of effort and work and a single update can make your stuff detectable

[2025-06-19 00:28] iPower: [replying to dagger: "ive seen that most people write the bypasses befor..."]
yeah thats what i usually did

[2025-06-19 00:28] dagger: [replying to iPower: "i didnt try to make my solution generic. and its a..."]
thats probably why some fortnite stuff is hard to make and maintain

[2025-06-19 00:28] dagger: [replying to iPower: "yeah thats what i usually did"]
ah nice

[2025-06-19 00:29] iPower: [replying to dagger: "thats probably why some fortnite stuff is hard to ..."]
you can apply that to all games tbh. now its pretty common to see more than one anti-cheat being used

[2025-06-19 00:29] iPower: its usually commercial ac + own thing

[2025-06-19 00:29] iPower: an anti-tamper as well

[2025-06-19 00:29] dagger: yeah like serverside anticheats and such

[2025-06-19 00:29] dagger: so what is the main way of bypassing those kinds of games?

[2025-06-19 00:29] dagger: is there no "easy" path to it

[2025-06-19 00:30] iPower: [replying to dagger: "so what is the main way of bypassing those kinds o..."]
the old way: lots of testing and reversing xd

[2025-06-19 00:30] dagger: haha yeah id assume so

[2025-06-19 00:30] dagger: but making a driver would be more work right?

[2025-06-19 00:30] iPower: really depends on which anti-cheat you're attacking and their flaws

[2025-06-19 00:30] iPower: but id say a driver is like almost mandatory nowadays

[2025-06-19 00:31] iPower: unless the ac has some pretty fucked up flaws like battleye used to

[2025-06-19 00:31] dagger: yeah siege cheats used to be easier because battleye was so bad

[2025-06-19 00:31] iPower: its still possible to have a full usermode cheat depending on the anti-cheat

[2025-06-19 00:31] dagger: iirc

[2025-06-19 00:31] dagger: [replying to iPower: "its still possible to have a full usermode cheat d..."]
yeah like vac

[2025-06-19 00:31] iPower: but sometimes it requires a lot of effort

[2025-06-19 00:31] dagger: but i cant think of anything else than vac

[2025-06-19 00:32] iPower: [replying to dagger: "yeah like vac"]
ah this applies even for so-called "kernel anti-cheats"

[2025-06-19 00:32] dagger: i mean cant you made any cheat usermode if the anticheat isnt kernel level?

[2025-06-19 00:32] dagger: [replying to iPower: "ah this applies even for so-called "kernel anti-ch..."]
ohh i didnt know

[2025-06-19 00:32] dagger: hows that possible

[2025-06-19 00:32] iPower: exploiting flaws in the anti-cheat, pretty much

[2025-06-19 00:32] dagger: so hiding ur cheat in usermode

[2025-06-19 00:32] iPower: like whitelisting, race conditions, etc

[2025-06-19 00:32] dagger: ohh

[2025-06-19 00:33] dagger: i see

[2025-06-19 00:33] iPower: theres no generic solution. really depends on what the anti-cheat is doing and what are their flaws

[2025-06-19 00:33] dagger: is finding flaws trial and error or are their flaws documented

[2025-06-19 00:34] iPower: pretty much trial and error, unless some anti-cheat is literally copying and pasting another one that already had their flaws documented

[2025-06-19 00:34] dagger: anticheat skidding

[2025-06-19 00:34] dagger: didnt know that was a thing lol

[2025-06-19 00:34] iPower: yep thats a real thing <:kekw:672146498401599488>

[2025-06-19 00:35] dagger: more often than not?

[2025-06-19 00:35] iPower: its not really common and most people dont even notice when reversing acs

[2025-06-19 00:35] iPower: but it definitely happens

[2025-06-19 00:35] dagger: hm

[2025-06-19 00:36] iPower: ill give some examples in a few

[2025-06-19 00:36] dagger: so if that happened u would see patterns and matching in the disassembler

[2025-06-19 00:36] dagger: oh okay no rush

[2025-06-19 00:57] iPower: aite im back

[2025-06-19 00:57] iPower: [replying to dagger: "so if that happened u would see patterns and match..."]
yes. the order of how things are done, the APIs that are called, the way the things are done. sometimes even the same signatures are used to find something

[2025-06-19 00:59] iPower: you have either acs copying another projects or acs copying themselves

[2025-06-19 01:00] iPower: one example for the former is battleye copying processhacker code for stack walking

[2025-06-19 01:01] iPower: one example for the latter is other acs yoiking vgks detections for patchguard bypasses

[2025-06-19 01:01] iPower: another example is faceit yoiking vgks idea of using LBR in their mouseclassservicecallback hook

[2025-06-19 01:01] iPower: there are many more

[2025-06-19 01:02] iPower: ive seen esportal copying esea's IAT hooks

[2025-06-19 01:02] iPower: faceit yoiking EACs system threads scans

[2025-06-19 01:36] dagger: faceit is just every other anticheat system skidded into one large one from that 🤣

[2025-06-19 06:22] Timmy: but you gotta face it... it's pretty good.

[2025-06-19 06:25] dagger: [replying to Timmy: "but you gotta face it... it's pretty good."]
No pun intended

ACE moment

[2025-06-19 14:32] daax: copying hv detections into their entry point from github without any alterations, same ordering of the checks too. wild.

vac is becoming more and more a pure serverside AC

[2025-06-19 16:21] elias: from what I‘ve heard the serverside AI is working quite well now

[2025-06-19 19:09] daax: [replying to elias: "from what I‘ve heard the serverside AI is working ..."]
where have you heard this? I don't think their ML stuff is doing much more than it did previously since the number of cheaters is still wildly out of control in their matchmaking -- I think people put too much stock into AI/ML anti-cheats to catch more than outliers/spinners.

pro players wouldnt be begging valve to fix their anti-cheat if it was working well lol

[2025-06-20 00:52] iPower: every player that cares about a good experience doesnt touch mm

[2025-06-20 00:58] elias: Well, when I say its working „well“ I mean that for vac standards. In the past year they improved the AI part to a point where spinbotting and other blantant cheats are completely fixed. Legit cheaters are still a big problem, but I still think its a quite an achievment for an serverside only AC. I think in the 10 years of CSGO they never remotely managed to get „rage cheating“/spinbotting under control

[2025-06-20 00:58] elias: also given the rapid improvement, as in early 2024 the game was basically unplayable due to cheaters

[2025-06-20 01:01] elias: [replying to f00d: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFyVRdRcilQ"]
and yeah this is still embarrasing lol

Completely fixed? What? No shot. There are still people with standard non-linear aimbots flying around in competitive. It’s hardly an achievement given you can catch spinbotting and hard locking aimbots without “AI”.

[2025-06-20 04:04] toasts: didn’t valve also disable overwatch for months to collect data for vac live? even though they 100% had enough data

real question is… how do we get in on the action?

[2025-06-20 04:46] daax: I wonder how many ML anti-cheat type platforms are gonna start spawning over the next 5 years — whether for interviews/live coding/classes/games

[2025-06-20 05:26] shalzuth: [replying to daax: "I wonder how many ML anti-cheat type platforms are..."]
I hope a lot. I want to believe in real ML anticheat, and we’ll get there faster if there’s a bunch of competition. I wish I could invest in that space.

[2025-06-20 07:53] Oliver: [replying to daax: "I wonder how many ML anti-cheat type platforms are..."]
i just dont see any ML anticheat that couldnt be done with "static" algorithms and calculations. Just seems like a marketing stunt... At least for games

[2025-06-20 08:04] koyz: Agree with Zepta here, slap 'AI' on it and with it comes a 500% upcharge

[2025-06-20 08:11] Xyrem: AI which relies on game stats + mouse/camera movement suck. Anything other than the meme linear aim calculations will not be caught

[2025-06-20 11:13] donna🤯: [replying to daax: "I wonder how many ML anti-cheat type platforms are..."]
theres already a few for interviews and it was open sourced - it quite literally enumerated windows and did a string comparison

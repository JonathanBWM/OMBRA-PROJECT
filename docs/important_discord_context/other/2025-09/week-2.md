To be fair, if you're good at reading and know how to actually "learn" it's not hard.

Most devs seem to struggle with both of these things

[2025-09-08 10:42] Vonnegut: Maybe I am biased though, I've worked at some real good and bad places, the "harder" work has always with people who can't read a manual

<:real:1393276555312103444> the only times I avoid a manual is when I build IKEA furniture and I always regret it

Not worth $300 for them to teach you some stuff you could learn by studying public repos

What was the course like? Did they actually just teach you stuff you could have learned from public GitHub repos?

[2025-09-10 18:51] the horse: [replying to J: "Not worth $300 for them to teach you some stuff yo..."]
not worth buying a book when you can find 50 articles describing its content 🤯

you can definitely learn all of that from a public github repos if you look hard enough

[2025-09-10 18:53] BWA RBX: [replying to the horse: "you can definitely learn all of that from a public..."]
But within the course material itself can you be certain there is information within there that you cannot find elsewhere?

[2025-09-10 18:54] the horse: to a reasonable degree, yes, you're most likely to be able to find it elsewhere

[2025-09-10 18:54] the horse: besides personal commentary

[2025-09-10 18:55] BWA RBX: If I really think about it, that's just like other courses by other industry veterans, like when I was studying devirtualization, and I looked into buying Rolf Rolles courses, tempting but never eventually got round to it

[2025-09-10 18:55] the horse: but imo a lot of scattered commentary on these topics is usually not very documented

[2025-09-10 18:55] the horse: so if they're properly explained in depth, why they work, how they can be mitigated, how you can strengthen them

[2025-09-10 18:55] BWA RBX: I was going to travel etc

[2025-09-10 18:55] the horse: then i'd say it's reasonable

[2025-09-10 18:56] the horse: it's a small chunk of money compared to most red/blue team courses on application security

[2025-09-10 18:56] BWA RBX: But if I must be honest I think that most course material from course teachers can be found online somewhere right?

[2025-09-10 18:56] the horse: of course

[2025-09-10 18:56] the horse: the quality of the teacher depends on how well he can explain such concepts in theory and practice

[2025-09-10 18:56] BWA RBX: Exactly

[2025-09-10 18:57] the horse: and if dealing with beginners, how he can dumb it down enough to create a foundation to branch from

[2025-09-10 18:57] the horse: i'd say if it describes the concepts and methods just in that screenshot

[2025-09-10 18:57] the horse: it's worth $300 for a beginner (not a beginner programmer)

[2025-09-10 18:58] mtu: “The same info available on GitHub so it can’t be a good course” is about the same level of argument as “no point in a PhD you can just read journal articles for free”

[2025-09-10 18:58] the horse: and besides, 90% of the anti-cheat test repos are unreadable garbage without explanation

[2025-09-10 18:58] the horse: just a collection of detections

[2025-09-10 18:59] the horse: good luck learning anything of value from it besides "this thing is bad"

[2025-09-10 19:00] the horse: the best free course of action is to look through <@609487237331288074> entire chat history here<:kappa:1115968816812392470>

[2025-09-10 19:00] the horse: there are many 'tygoodshare^^' moments

[2025-09-10 19:01] the horse: either way I think starting learning on the defensive side is a bad strategy

[2025-09-10 19:01] the horse: you should drill yourself on offensive tasks

[2025-09-10 19:02] BWA RBX: [replying to mtu: "“The same info available on GitHub so it can’t be ..."]
Exactly the philosophy of that argument is fallacious within itself so I just wanted to question it, and figure why such a bizarre response is necessary to someone who trying to educate others on a subject they probably have studied relentlessly, the price can be debatable but that wasn't the premise of his assumption of the course itself.

[2025-09-10 19:02] the horse: or you'll end up reinforcing a door and the attacker will just break a window

[2025-09-10 19:02] DirtySecreT: [replying to J: "Not worth $300 for them to teach you some stuff yo..."]
ig. seems reasonable to want to have it aggregated. the content on the site isnt all bad

[2025-09-10 19:03] DirtySecreT: [replying to the horse: "you can definitely learn all of that from a public..."]
i dont necessarily disagree but if you dont know what you dont know then you will never look for those repos or find them. maybe by luck

[2025-09-10 19:03] the horse: point is you can learn anything that way but the difficulty increases with it (as you said, you'd have to look super hard if you even knew what to look for in the first place)

[2025-09-10 19:04] DirtySecreT: [replying to mtu: "“The same info available on GitHub so it can’t be ..."]
totally different thing he's talking about

[2025-09-10 19:05] DirtySecreT: the information is out there for free, they just decided to repackage the same info, and paywall it. there is a site people like to cite

[2025-09-10 19:05] DirtySecreT: malacademy is a big offender of repackaging public repos with a mild explanation

[2025-09-10 19:06] DirtySecreT: why would you pay for that? a phd is much more in depth specialization and research in an area. you also wind up doing the same thing as digging through repos and existing research to conduct yours or find a starting point

[2025-09-10 19:10] DirtySecreT: <@901468996229025873> is basically saying dont buy $300 courses that are shallow repacks of free content

[2025-09-10 19:11] the horse: no no

[2025-09-10 19:11] the horse: that's not what i was saying at all

[2025-09-10 19:11] the horse: I recognized the value in it, i opposed it being a fundamentally bad idea

[2025-09-10 19:11] DirtySecreT: then what were you getting at?

[2025-09-10 19:11] the horse: [replying to J: "Not worth $300 for them to teach you some stuff yo..."]
i was responding to him

[2025-09-10 19:11] DirtySecreT: i see

[2025-09-10 19:11] the horse: and the other guy asked me whether i could find everything they might be discussing online

[2025-09-10 19:11] the horse: i said yes, but so what?

[2025-09-10 19:11] DirtySecreT: got it, i understand now point still stands in general

[2025-09-10 19:11] the horse: you can do that with many educational books across various topics, doesn't strip the value from them though

[2025-09-10 19:14] mtu: Almost all formal education is paying people to repack publicly available knowledge

[2025-09-10 19:15] mtu: I agree there’s a large degree of variation in quality in courses/education material but the original comment was “no point in paying you can learn the same thing  by reading public repos”

[2025-09-10 19:15] DirtySecreT: [replying to mtu: "Almost all formal education is paying people to re..."]
ya predictable response. phds are a different beast. im not talking about generic formal education.

[2025-09-10 19:16] mtu: PhDs are probably even more applicable since sort of the whole thing is that there’s nothing for you to study per se, you’re “generating new knowledge” in the form of a thesis

[2025-09-10 19:16] DirtySecreT: the difference is whether it adds structure, some kind of subject matter expertise and-or an original contribution. a phd does. a $300 slideshow of github does not lol

[2025-09-10 19:17] mtu: So why pay for someone else to watch you discover new things 🙂

[2025-09-10 19:24] DirtySecreT: [replying to mtu: "So why pay for someone else to watch you discover ..."]
> “The same info available on GitHub so it can’t be a good course” is about the same level of argument as “no point in a PhD you can just read journal articles for free”
you said dismissing a course because the info exists for free is the same as like dismissing a phd because papers are free is silly, but this is a bad comparison imo. phd isnt copy-paste repackaging and a course that remixes sloppily to publicly documented info isnt really useful for guided discovery. youre just rebranding material without any new insight. theres a big difference between lazy courses and well structured courses. buying a $300 course for lots of these things is silly because the quality is usually low. idk what phds are like where you are but when i was in uni they weren't comparable to copy-pasting github repos.

[2025-09-10 19:24] DirtySecreT: it's not the same argument. that's my point. you made the argument "saying x" is the same as "saying y" ... it's not lol

[2025-09-10 19:24] mtu: So you’re saying…. They’re both horrible arguments against the quality of the relevant education

[2025-09-10 19:24] mtu: Which was my point

[2025-09-10 19:26] daax: [replying to mtu: "So you’re saying…. They’re both horrible arguments..."]
Nah, the courses are ass. A PhD, depending on where you are going to uni, is a much different style and structure of education. I would sooner pay for an education like a PhD in the EU that gives me the tools and ideas to come up with original ideas than some hogwash that packed a bunch of public sources into a video that they discuss. I would agree that this isn't a good comparison, they're not remotely equivalent in quality, structure, or depth.

[2025-09-10 19:27] mtu: A PhD is generally closer to a well structured internship than what most people would consider education, yes

[2025-09-10 19:28] mtu: I’m saying that arguing PhDs are worthless because you could just read through journal articles is a bad argument

[2025-09-10 19:29] DirtySecreT: [replying to mtu: "I’m saying that arguing PhDs are worthless because..."]
what? you say "the same info is available on github so it cant be a good course" its not the same level of argument as "no point in a PhD you can just read journal articles for free"

[2025-09-10 19:29] DirtySecreT: thats what im saying

[2025-09-10 19:29] mtu: How is it not, if you agree they’re both bad arguments?

[2025-09-10 19:29] mtu: Them both being bad arguments was literally the point

[2025-09-10 19:30] DirtySecreT: what? one is a reasonable argument (the first) the latter isnt comparable

[2025-09-10 19:30] DirtySecreT: i dont agree with you that's why im arguing

[2025-09-10 19:31] Oliver: [replying to mtu: "I’m saying that arguing PhDs are worthless because..."]
school is a great way of learning no matter what anyone says. Most people are not able to learn in a propriate way themself

[2025-09-10 19:31] mtu: Then our disagreement is whether “same info is available on GitHub makes it a bad course” not whether the PhD statement is a good argument

[2025-09-10 19:32] mtu: I agree the PhD thing is a bad argument

[2025-09-10 19:32] mtu: That’s why I put it there

[2025-09-10 19:33] Oliver: [replying to mtu: "Then our disagreement is whether “same info is ava..."]
most good sources are in the industry...

[2025-09-10 19:34] Oliver: and are hidden in companies

[2025-09-10 19:34] mtu: Meh, I agree with the idea that, to first order, most things you’d want to know are available in the public domain

[2025-09-10 19:35] mtu: It’s just that discovering which references are good, then parsing them to figure out the good vs bad, is not trivial

If free, this is a very good resource. You will figure out how a basic AC works and how to evade them. These days you have to directly attack the AC or just go somewhere where they can do nothing (UEFI for example). A lot of people will tell you to deobfuscate via lifting pattern matching yada yada. It's too hard to learn within a few weeks.

I think you should just go around them as much as possible. Many mini PC's ship with a default test signed BIOS. You can easily spoof secure boot, boot device, and TPM(at bare min level). It is very easy to send input. Your only issue would be rendering.

If it's not Vanguard it's very easy to make a p2c. This will make many cringe, but your only issue will be running out of bypasses.

Never understood the concept of locking other people's content behind a paywall that will only give money to the website owner

[2025-09-11 00:26] the horse: they pay for articles

[2025-09-11 00:26] the horse: whether it's worth the time depends on whether you're european or american

[2025-09-11 00:26] the horse: so the authors are compensated at least

[2025-09-11 00:27] selfprxvoked: Oh, got it 👍

[2025-09-11 00:40] miikul: Howdy folks, I've got a question to ask: how did you guys get so good? There's a lot of people on this server that are clearly very knowledgable, about anti-cheats and reverse engineering, which what I'm really interested in, but even with the resources available to me, the secret.club website, the git repos on github and back.engineering, daax' posts on both UC and revers.engineering, flare-on CTFs, the blogs from project zero, it feels like I'll never really get to their level. Maybe this is a really dumb question to ask, because I haven't tried my absolute hardest or exhausted all my options, so I know there's room for improvement, but I have a really bad habit of comparing myself with other people, and I constantly put myself down, to the point where it kind of kills the initial spark I had for learn about computers. With ACs specifically, I assume most people learn by putting in the hours, trial and error, figuring it out themselves by actually trying, and I assume it's like that for most hard-to-learn things like playing around with UEFI/TPM/secure-boot, ring -1 hypervisors, CR3, devirtualization, but I don't see myself being able to do those things on my own. Heck I wouldn't even know how to get a dump of VAC, nor do I think I'll be able to do this. So for the people that have crossed that seemingly insurmountable mountain (of learning ACs), I'd like to ask if it's not as bad as I make it out to be.

[2025-09-11 00:40] miikul: I've just recently started with kernel stuff, I have a basic understanding of IOCTL, but I'm just not sure where to go from there. I though I'd try just debugging windows and whatever functions were exported by ntoskrnl.exe to maybe figure out how SSDT works and syscalls, but then it felt like I was aimlessly trying to do whatever I thought might be important. Considering SSDT hooks haven't been used for a while from some quick google searches, it definitely amplified that feeling that I had no idea how to approach learning anti-cheats at all (and in retrospect, just because an old bypass no longer works I don't believe that makes learning it useless, so I think I was wrong for giving up knowing that modern ACs check for these things, I should still have tried to communciate to UM that way).

[2025-09-11 00:41] miikul: And I think I should mention I'm not asking for a step-by-step guide, that kind of removes the joy of figuring something out yourself, at least for me (and I really want to be able to do these things myself), but I do want to know what other people's approaches were, for me I decided I'd just try to learn as much about windows, but I'm probably missing something. If there's anything I should add more detail on, let me know, and thanks to whoever took the time to read this goddamn essay.

[2025-09-11 00:44] the horse: `but I don't see myself being able to do those things on my own`

yes you can and that's the way to go; just gotta force yourself

[2025-09-11 00:44] the horse: start with something simpler, i'd suggest FiveM's anti-cheat

[2025-09-11 00:44] the horse: going on the offense will bring you much needed practice & experience to try and do the defense

[2025-09-11 00:50] Mikewind22: You have to start early. If you are over 16-yo then it is too late.

[2025-09-11 03:00] iPower: as long as you have a clear goal, there's nothing stopping you 👍

[2025-09-11 03:01] iPower: use the other people to let yourself know where you want to be. don't use this as a discouragement

[2025-09-11 03:01] miikul: will do boss

[2025-09-11 03:02] iPower: sometimes I also feel like I'm lacking many things but then I remind myself that being better than I was yesterday is already a huge improvement

[2025-09-11 03:04] miikul: that helps a lot, I tend to do the same, but I give myself a little bigger of a time frame to compare myself to how I was to account for off days

[2025-09-11 03:06] miikul: But thank you for the words of advice I tend to forget these things after a while.

my guy I've been doing this stuff for ~16 years* (roughly half of that was "professionally") -- the answer is time and (for me) I genuinely enjoy learning new stuff, you have plenty of time to get to whatever level you want to pursue. don't use our current knowledge as a place to compare yourself, if you just started today... in 17 years you might be far past where we are today or even then. we're not geniuses, just people that love to learn and have put time in whenever we can, and we started long before you. sounds like that's what you have been doing, so stay the course and you will see results.

> With ACs specifically, I assume most people learn by putting in the hours, trial and error, figuring it out themselves by actually trying, and I assume it's like that for most hard-to-learn things like playing around with UEFI/TPM/secure-boot, ring -1 hypervisors, CR3, devirtualization, but I don't see myself being able to do those things on my own.
anyone who tells you they immediately were able to handle the toughest anti-cheats without months of research is full of it. most people who are genuinely knowledgable about these things, and in here there are many, have put in **years**. but they learned it through trial and error, and chasing the rabbit down the hole to solve a problem. I never would've gotten into hypervisors for instance had I not wanted to use one for tracing anti-cheats and trying to get more information. You absolutely can do them, if the lowest rung of UC can do it, you can if you take that mental barrier away. You asked if they are as bad as people make it out to be: it depends. If you started with Valorant and VGK you're going to quit. The barrier to entry to be successful and have any sort of reliable result is insanely high. I would say, don't bother -- also anime cs is stupid. Start with small pieces, PunkBuster did some interesting things, and would be manageable as an example. Some anti-cheats are very advanced, and very tedious to reverse engineer (EAC/VGK/ESEA/FACEIT/etc) -- those will beat you up for a while, happened to me and happens to everyone. There's a lot of posturing by people that they've just been able to ace ACs, but it's all a front lol. Everyone gets sand kicked in there face at least a handful of times before they have the tooling and understanding down.

> I've just recently started with kernel stuff, I have a basic understanding of IOCTL, but I'm just not sure where to go from there.
Pick a subsystem you find interesting, and poke at it -- reverse engineer it, come up with ways to track how information flows, you'll wind up learning so much about the tools you're working with, new ways to find information, and you'll probably yak shave for months -- but you'll learn a lot along the way even if it's non-linear. That's how most people here got their depth. Chasing rabbits, building tools, getting more familiar with the tools. I used to reverse engineer things by only setting breakpoints and trying to chase things in the callstack when I first started, then I learned about oplocks and thought, "hm, instead of having to attach a debugger, place a breakpoint, and risk getting the debugger detected before the BP is hit (assuming I can't use titanhide for some reason)... what if I put an oplock on the file and attached when it hung and waited for the release then placed a BP?" It worked out and I was able to attach and break in at the right time after all their debug checks but before the majority of license validation went through. You just learn as you go.

And the biggest mistake people make is they don't ask questions. They shoot themselves in the foot by doing that. Ask questions, lots of them, be thorough with your question, what you've tried, what you think didn't work, what you're trying to do, etc. You will get far more quality answers if you ask questions with detail. Nobody knows everything, so, ask questions -- this is a great place to ask as long as you're giving a good faith effort to learn and resolve the problem.

dose hook swapcontext need change HalCaptureLastBranchRecordStack  ptr ?

[2025-09-11 04:14] DirtySecreT: you guys are pretty next level but for someone just starting out i could see it being daunting to wonder "will i ever ..."... tbh <@781367932575154186> the people here knowledge share all the time, take advantage of that

in the kernel that is all you need to change. idk what ur trying to do though you said halcapture

I found someone change HalCaptureLastBranchRecordStack ptr. I try to know why they do it

[2025-09-11 04:17] moshui: I want to know his role

[2025-09-11 04:17] moshui: "new" infinity hook?

[2025-09-11 04:18] DirtySecreT: [replying to moshui: ""new" infinity hook?"]
not new it was discussed in blog post

[2025-09-11 04:18] DirtySecreT: and ya its called in etw routine for trace lbr

[2025-09-11 04:19] the horse: doesn't ACE run a hypervisor now under Intel? (if virtualization is enabled)

[2025-09-11 04:19] DirtySecreT: so probably for that same hook

[2025-09-11 04:19] DirtySecreT: that is described here

i think that is only the ccp version

[2025-09-11 04:20] moshui: [replying to the horse: "doesn't ACE run a hypervisor now under Intel? (if ..."]
in China is right

[2025-09-11 06:34] Tmz: [replying to the horse: "doesn't ACE run a hypervisor now under Intel? (if ..."]
yes in cpp version

[2025-09-11 06:34] Tmz: but i think can do vt nesting

[2025-09-12 17:10] rar: how can you cheat if theres a anticheat

[2025-09-12 17:11] Addison: by cheating the anticheat

[2025-09-13 00:37] rar: [replying to Addison: "by cheating the anticheat"]
but what if theres a anticheat for a anticheat

[2025-09-13 00:37] rar: also im slow is there aany bypasses shit for gta v online

same, idk either

[2025-09-13 01:07] iPower: have always been an EAC guy

[2025-09-13 01:07] iPower: not that I'm up to date with EAC as well, but...

[2025-09-13 01:07] oopsies: eac was tougher

[2025-09-13 01:08] iPower: it still is. way more than you imagine

[2025-09-13 01:08] oopsies: they were more aggressive and gave us hell

[2025-09-13 01:09] iPower: if I were to guess though, nothing really "changed" regarding BE

[2025-09-13 01:09] iPower: BE is a giant paste

[2025-09-13 01:09] oopsies: [replying to iPower: "BE is a giant paste"]
you could load a bunch of random rwx .dlls

[2025-09-13 01:10] iPower: there are still some ways to inject your dlls easily

hmm.. that always confused me

[2025-09-13 01:12] oopsies: EAC and Vanguard forced me into minimum wage, now I cant pay for college. Then work overlaps with college and I had to quit my job for some gig stuff.

no one will find me

[2025-09-13 01:23] iPower: no one will find you but you're getting banned

[2025-09-13 01:23] oopsies: if they found me i shouldve been executed 5 years ago

[2025-09-13 01:23] oopsies: no

[2025-09-13 01:23] iPower: enjoy your life

[2025-09-13 01:24] oopsies: i face death penalty

[2025-09-13 01:24] oopsies: alr

[2025-09-13 01:24] oopsies: imma stop

[2025-09-13 01:24] iPower: enough with the nonsense. this is a place to discuss anti-cheat internals

[2025-09-13 01:24] iPower: last warning

[2025-09-13 02:46] the horse: [replying to rar: "also im slow is there aany bypasses shit for gta v..."]
the anti-cheat is very simple

[2025-09-13 02:47] the horse: the only real headache you might encounter is getting lua execution to work

[2025-09-13 02:47] rar: i js wanna be able to inject sum shi without being banned

[2025-09-13 02:49] the horse: otherwise it's pretty straightforward - they have a mutex on the integrity check you can easily locate automatically, and lock
you can hijack the exception handler registered by CoreRT by waiting until it's hijacked by adhesive.dll - finding a codecave in adhesive, patching the code to a jmp thunk to your code and changing the data pointer to the code cave-- then you can instrument exceptions. Afterwards, hijack all syscalls by patching them to something that will generate an exception (like icebp), and hiding your cheat from any relevant scans, as well as taking care of working set scans -- lastly, you'll patch the integrity check (iirc there's 2-3 places it might trigger from) and you're good to go

[2025-09-13 02:50] rar: yeah so

[2025-09-13 02:50] rar: im dumb

[2025-09-13 02:50] rar: ik vangauard

[2025-09-13 02:50] rar: vanguard

[2025-09-13 02:50] rar: never worked with be

[2025-09-13 02:50] rar: i tried bottleye and failed

[2025-09-13 02:50] rar: idk how

[2025-09-13 03:02] the horse: [replying to rar: "i tried bottleye and failed"]
patched

[2025-09-13 03:02] the horse: in its essence it still works

[2025-09-13 03:03] the horse: but you wont find something thats public and atill mostly works

[2025-09-13 03:03] the horse: besides maybe voyager

[2025-09-13 03:04] rar: so im cooked or try find a private

re hooking syscalls, doesn't vmp try to inline the syscalls if it detects a supported version of windows: https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=modern%20Windows%20versions

you used to be able to bypass this by using an insider build of windows if i recall correctly.

[2025-09-13 19:28] the horse: you patch all syscalls

[2025-09-13 19:28] the horse: with something akin to a bp

[2025-09-13 19:28] the horse: and then instrument it

this, there was an elaborate algorithm behind it

[2025-09-22 14:26] pinefin: but there was also a function along the lines of 'ricochetBullet' or 'reflectBullet'

[2025-09-22 14:26] pinefin: this method is bye bye though

[2025-09-22 14:26] pinefin: they patched it within 2 weeks of that video from lvndmark

[2025-09-22 14:26] pinefin: <@1075945855082836029>

[2025-09-22 14:27] pinefin: i fully recreated the bullet travel system to make a bullet drop prediction, and let me tell you, never again

[2025-09-22 14:33] pinefin: [replying to daax: "for a while in EFT there was no z-clipping so you ..."]
i saw one cheat that combined this with a walk-through-floor exploit to get under the map and beam anyone because you could just shoot through everything from under the map🤣

[2025-09-22 14:34] Brit: I expect that you get clapped basically immediately for doing that

[2025-09-22 14:34] pinefin: sadly not

[2025-09-22 14:34] pinefin: nowadays, probably

[2025-09-22 14:34] Brit: I cannot imagine an account doing that lasting more than a few hours

[2025-09-22 14:34] pinefin: but back then it was really annoying getting in a lobby with people that used it

[2025-09-22 15:31] phil: that's so old and you'd get banned 20 mins after using certain features LOL

[2025-09-22 15:36] phil: lol we used to do carries with it, im very well aware how fast it got clapped , anyways it was the same with phasing through walls and floors, would get us clapped in 1h

[2025-09-22 15:36] pinefin: oh you're one of those 🤣

[2025-09-22 15:37] phil: man thats like 4 years ago

[2025-09-22 15:37] phil: and no i make my own stuff 😵

[2025-09-22 15:40] Brit: [replying to phil: "and no i make my own stuff 😵"]
I can tell with the pattern that has 4 wildcards bytes trailing  :^)

[2025-09-22 15:40] phil: : )

[2025-09-22 17:09] brymko: big call

[2025-09-22 17:43] pinefin: -# i dont think ive heard of anyone explicitly saying they make their own stuff before

[2025-09-22 17:45] phil: lol, cant even realize its a troll 😂

[2025-09-22 17:46] Brit: [replying to phil: "lol, cant even realize its a troll 😂"]
it was such a troll that you decided to replace it

[2025-09-22 17:46] Brit: ✅

[2025-09-22 17:46] phil: Funny how u got offended by me saying razor, nword hack sucks

[2025-09-22 17:46] pinefin: where did you say razor?

[2025-09-22 17:46] Brit: you good my brother? we don't to p2c discussion here

[2025-09-22 17:48] pinefin: alright we're flooding this channel lets just stop here, you're making a fool of yourself as well

[2025-09-23 10:33] Leg1tSoul: Loot teleport was wilder

[2025-09-23 12:08] the horse: rust shit was crazy too

[2025-09-23 12:08] the horse: back in the days

[2025-09-23 14:28] pinefin: [replying to the horse: "rust shit was crazy too"]
oh god rust was so fun to magic bullet on

[2025-09-23 14:28] pinefin: are we just reminiscing now 🤣

[2025-09-23 14:28] the horse: still a lot of cool shit you can do

[2025-09-23 14:29] pinefin: loot through walls was a good one

[2025-09-23 14:29] the horse: rocket tp was pretty good

[2025-09-23 14:29] pinefin: oh?

[2025-09-23 14:29] pinefin: 🤣 what

[2025-09-23 14:30] the horse: 2021/2022

[2025-09-23 14:30] pinefin: bobby's friend had a cool exploit because there was a small pixel between each wall

[2025-09-23 14:30] pinefin: you could loot through walls

[2025-09-23 14:30] the horse: i remember proxy server cheats

[2025-09-23 14:30] pinefin: or TC yourself

[2025-09-23 15:41] madz (cat): never really got into FM

[2025-09-23 15:41] pinefin: adhesive was fun to reverse

it sucks ass

im saying it was a fun adventure

[2025-09-23 15:53] iPower: just a reminder that this channel isn't for flexing your shitty cheats

[2025-09-23 15:54] the horse: cheat dev journey -> <#1378136917501284443>

[2025-09-23 15:54] iPower: if you don't have anything to share about battleye and adhesive, cut it off

[2025-09-23 15:54] iPower: not the correct place for flexing whatever your whack ass p2c is

[2025-09-23 15:55] madz (cat): it’s not a P2C?

[2025-09-23 15:55] iPower: i don't care what it is. you do not make the rules here

[2025-09-23 15:55] madz (cat): lmao

[2025-09-23 15:55] iPower: just stop it or gtfo

[2025-09-23 15:55] the horse: anyways;

do any multiplayer games still utilize punk buster?

[2025-09-23 15:56] aslrnk: 🥀

Bf4 does somewhere right?

[2025-09-23 15:59] the horse: I think it did use that, yeah

[2025-09-23 15:59] pinefin: it did

[2025-09-23 15:59] the horse: do you know if the older versions like bad company 2 use it?

[2025-09-23 15:59] madz (cat): [replying to the horse: "do you know if the older versions like bad company..."]
isn’t this googleable information?

[2025-09-23 16:00] the horse: trying to start a conversation with someone who's explored it in these games

[2025-09-23 16:00] the horse: crazy right

[2025-09-23 16:02] the horse: another funny thing: the contracts with punkbuster expired for some games already; so it might not be available (COD for example)

[2025-09-23 16:03] the horse: which my original question builds upon

[2025-09-23 16:07] madz (cat): [replying to the horse: "do you know if the older versions like bad company..."]
it did but since the servers are down i think everyone moved to VU for BC2

[2025-09-23 16:12] madz (cat): [replying to the horse: "trying to start a conversation with someone who's ..."]
is there anything in specific you are looking at?

[2025-09-23 16:12] madz (cat): i.e. bypassing screenshots etc?

[2025-09-23 16:12] the horse: not really; just wanted to take it apart but wanted to know if it's actually live/used anywhere nowadays

[2025-09-23 16:13] madz (cat): i fear that linking to the UC page on punkbuster is not good for mai survival

[2025-09-23 16:13] madz (cat): *but* it does list games that use it

[2025-09-23 16:13] the horse: ty

[2025-09-23 16:13] Brit: [replying to madz (cat): "i fear that linking to the UC page on punkbuster i..."]
that's fine

the only things that are forbidden here:
* extremely cringe behavior (that includes cheat/p2c flexing)
* markov chaining
* AI slop

[2025-09-23 16:22] iPower: other than that you're good

[2025-09-23 16:23] iPower: we don't mind links to UC as long as it provides useful information

[2025-09-23 16:25] madz (cat): [replying to iPower: "the only things that are forbidden here:

i wasn’t going to get back into this since i didn’t see it being productive but i really really fail to see how me showing mai personal private cheat with the name covered counts as flexing. 

1) it’s not a P2C, i understand maybe that’s a small pedantic thing for you maybe, but if it’s literally not sold and the name is covered i fail to see how it’s an issue.

2) i view it as related to the convo. Mai responding was, it felt dumb to claim that an anticheat was poorly implemented if i was completely talking out mai ass with nothing to back it up.

[2025-09-23 16:25] madz (cat): i really am not pressed about it

[2025-09-23 16:26] madz (cat): it’s y’all’s server so if you say nuh uh to cheat SS so be it

[2025-09-23 16:26] iPower: hey let me teach you something

-# small question, whats markov chaining

[2025-09-23 16:26] madz (cat): [replying to pinefin: "-# small question, whats markov chaining"]
it just guesses what word is next base on stats typically (ultra simplification of one application)

[2025-09-23 16:26] iPower: nobody cares if you're showing your cheat working against battleye. we care about information

[2025-09-23 16:26] madz (cat): kinda a way to implement NLP type stuff

[2025-09-23 16:27] iPower: if you say battleye is bad please show evidence (I do agree BE sucks, but that's not the way to discuss the inner workings of an anti-cheat)

[2025-09-23 16:27] iPower: and by evidence I mean what is BE doing bad... what can be improved

[2025-09-23 16:28] iPower: not "heheheehehehe here's my cheat loaded"

[2025-09-23 16:28] iPower: like I said it being p2c or not it's pretty much the same behavior

[2025-09-23 16:28] Brit: [replying to pinefin: "-# small question, whats markov chaining"]
it's a common thing you see when interviewing people for junior positions and you ask them about something they do not know about and they start throwing up words that are contextually meaningful but just do not mean anything in the order they use them. (A thing that happens when a markov chain is created from a corpus)

[2025-09-23 16:28] iPower: we have plenty of markov chaining examples here

this conversation could have been moar productive if you would have opened with this. i see your point.

[2025-09-23 16:31] the horse: as if it isn't obvious

this conversation could have been "moar" productive if you hadn't shared a random screenshot that nobody gives a damn

I remember seeing some papers about reliable memory side channel attacks detection before 2020 and thought that maybe this was already implemented in modern AVs? But yeah I asked the question in a really lazy way

The main guy behind battleye is always Bastian Suter, not sure about his personal BE email, so maybe just also try the support@battleye.com contact or the direct contact form from their website

is that someones name?

[2025-09-24 22:09] abu: [replying to pinefin: "is that someones name?"]
Yeah lol, he was around in like 2017 I think

[2025-09-24 22:15] pinefin: thats probably before my time in cheating. i was 12/13 at that time 🤣

[2025-09-24 22:15] pinefin: i think i was using a\*\*\*\*\*\* on csgo way back then, right when i first started cheating in games. so yeah, i wouldnt know any clue who you're talking about

[2025-09-26 17:00] cat enjoyer: is HPTT truly that undetectable as most people say? I don't know if pcie DMA is anyhow visible, I don't know even if it leaves traces on the processor cache

[2025-09-26 17:04] cat enjoyer: what is the route the hardware takes for DMA? if its completely independent to the processor and it can't catch it, does that mean a halted machine could have its memory read by dma? im afraid im asking a stupid question

ah🤣 it still looks like ai slop

[2025-09-28 12:11] cat enjoyer: did some research on dma and a new question came to my mind: why are there DMA cheats for faceit, still? doesn't faceit implement IOMMU with no identity mapping? or is there someone else to blame?

[2025-09-28 12:11] cat enjoyer: im not sure if I am remembering correctly but I believe I saw someone here mentioning Microsoft has a bad DMA protection and they trust some devices blindly

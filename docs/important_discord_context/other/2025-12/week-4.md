You should find a game without an anti-cheat to work on to learn fundamentals.

start with assautl cube and if you made a decent cheat you can go to cs2 with anti cheat turned off

That wasn't clear from your post. Keep working on games without anti-cheats, starting with VAC is a reasonable target because it's all usermode. If you go straight for dealing with anti-cheats that have a KM component you're going to have a tough go of it.

bro i think that i know the basics  i did cheat for 2 games assult cube and flipy bird and how many games that i have to cheat in to be able to go with large anti cheat and online game like fortnight and
cs2 and pubg

I don't think daax is saying build loads of cheats for loads of games.

[2025-12-22 13:25] gelower: It will help you learn the basics but after that you just need to start experimenting look online there are a lot of resources on the basics but don't just study actually build shit

I think you need to get your ego in check before someone else does it. You clearly DO NOT have enough experience if you don't know where the fuck to start, you didn't even know how to turn off the anti-cheat for CS2 which most non-cheaters do.

[2025-12-22 13:28] daax: Spend more time getting experience by making cheats for games with usermode anti-cheats, and then graduate to KM based ones once you are competent. You are not.

there are some good books out there on how windows works internally and a lot of other resources online but I'd be cautious jumping straight into kernel development. Experiment in usermode first  and then  venture out.

> bro I think that I know the basics
You don't, and talking to people like that is a quick way to piss them off when you're asking questions some of us have been answering for the last decade or more. The answer is always the same: start with UM based ACs, then go to KM. You turn the AC off while you learn the engine of the game and understand how to find information, then you spend time understanding how the AC is initialized (i.e. how VAC is loaded and runs) and then you spend time dumping and reversing it; AND then you make a cheat that you can go online with, and you will make mistakes and get banned a few times if you are a starter -- we all have experienced bans at some point or another while building something. You have to put in a lot of work to go from 0 to VAC with no experience, the amount of work required to cheat against BE/EAC without experience is WAY higher.

I'm a beginner and i can help you telling you what im doing based on the resources online and what i 
- Started with Assalt cube, made external and internal cheat. (learned basics, dll injection, func hooking, and how to read/write a process memory)  
- Moved to Combat Master and learned anti debugging and how it works. I understood how to evade with existin tools, now im trying to embed it inside my cheat. (btw still struggling to find offsets and pointers with cheat engine)  

At the same time im studying a bit of user level obfuscation and virtualization using VMP.

Edit: if you want easy and introduction material you can try some CTF even if they are mostly linux based.

ok that hard thin i think

[2025-12-22 13:38] 0xdeluks: Hi, not a game hacker, I think the tldr here is: if you know how to approach a user mode anti-cheats, you should be able to know how to approach kernel mode ones :))

[2025-12-22 13:39] daax: [replying to >_: "maybe i can ask  quastions  but as i say here just..."]
I gave you somewhat of a roadmap for CS2, for instance. I would say you should spend some time going through those steps; start with getting <whatever game> in a mode where the AC isn't running if possible (like -insecure on source games) and figuring out how to reference the Source SDK and infer implementations from that. You can also use a site like guidedhacking. They're great for beginners. You don't even need to do CS2, you can do any game old or new, day of defeat, TF2, etc. There was a guy learning by doing TF2 in here a bit back, his cheat looked great.

ou might think the way I ask questions comes across as if I already have experience, but that’s only because I’m enthusiastic and eager to dive into the learning process.

this is a prime example of <@1053012491006910504> spending time learning how they work and doing it in usermode, and doing it well. If you want a clear roadmap, guidedhacking has reasonable guides for this, video tutorials and such to teach you the basics, and when you get stuck you can ask whatever here.

I recommend re orienting away from cheating in games if you want to go to a higher level, like go do crackmes on crackmes.one, create an emulator in c or cpp, create your own hooking library etc.

[2025-12-22 14:20] iJaco25: i think to understand the basics OALabs has good tutorials, even if it is more malware oriented

Most of these come with the territory of game hacking. I don't think reorienting is going to do anything because concepts related to game hacking you won't learn anywhere else and will have to if you want to do it.

[2025-12-22 14:23] connor: That was just my experience

[2025-12-22 14:27] connor: I guess if you’re goal is to stick with VAC or games without anticheat it doesn’t matter that much, but I think it’s difficult to understand the tools or concepts you need to know for dealing with other AC

[2025-12-22 14:27] connor: Reversing crackmes gives you experience reversing things made to fight you, without the threat of getting banned

fair enough

[2025-12-22 14:28] ia32e: maybe crackme would be a really good entry point before rolling to the ac

[2025-12-22 14:29] ia32e: at least would make sense to learn more about security principles, debugging, obf, RE and such

[2025-12-24 08:40] bleh: Hallo 😄 ! i often hear the term "encrypted page " in uc and i wanted to just clarify it's not actual encryption right ? it's just mean that when a non whitelisted thread is executing, the physical page of the virtual address you are accessing is paged out ? ty in advance for the answer 🙂

[2025-12-24 08:42] gelower: [replying to bleh: "Hallo 😄 ! i often hear the term "encrypted page " ..."]
I think they do mean encrypted pages, page is still mapped in the games address space just contents is encrypted.

[2025-12-24 08:44] gelower: valorant iirc does what you are referring to, doesn't map some pages in the games address space and then has a hook inside of swap context, if a thread is whitelisted then write the dtb that has those pages mapped.

[2025-12-24 08:46] gelower: other games with encrypted pages use PAGE_NOACCESS protections on those pages, when accessed it triggers a page fault and then their exception handler decrypts page and changes protection if called from a valid region (they do alot more than just "is caller valid" but gets the idea across)

[2025-12-24 08:52] bleh: oh ok i see ty smch

[2025-12-24 08:54] bleh: so either borrow a whitelisted thread or finding a way to execute while an exception occur i assume (forgive my inexperience T-T)

[2025-12-24 08:56] gelower: the game ur targeting which of the two methods i mentioned does it use?

[2025-12-24 08:57] gelower: ahhh yeah most people don't do that, not ever touched valorant myself but from what i know people find the pml4 that contains the pages

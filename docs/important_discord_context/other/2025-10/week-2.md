[2025-10-10 15:22] notsapinho: I figured out a way to "decrypt" the hydra channel packets, so i could obtain a session key that is being exchanged

[2025-10-10 15:22] notsapinho: between the server and client

[2025-10-10 15:22] notsapinho: however when it comes to getting the session key on the client side

[2025-10-10 15:22] notsapinho: i can't figure out how to decrypt in the same way

[2025-10-10 15:24] notsapinho: it doesnt give me an error

[2025-10-10 15:24] notsapinho: but the response

[2025-10-10 15:24] notsapinho: is partially empty

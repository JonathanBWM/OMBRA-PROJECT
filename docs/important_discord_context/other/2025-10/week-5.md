Thanks for your reponse. I assume that not all EK's are signed by a Certificate Authority and so that's why Vanguard and other anti-cheats don't simply mass ban these people.

Yeah, the ban evasion guys aren't just spoofing the EK ,  they're forcing a TPM reset to generate a whole new trusted identity , which is way harder for the AC to detect than a simple hardware ID change.

The guy above said his EKpub changed when he flashed gigabyte (assuming) with qflash. I guess the bios vendors don’t seem to care about it or maybe there is a legitimate reason?

lukiuzzz is p2c reseller, he tried to hire me in the past, 
i strongly suspect him just larping here and reposting chatgpt responses

From their perspective, it's better to guarantee a clean, uncorrupted state after a flash , even if it means the TPM gets reseted.

[2025-10-29 15:34] pinefin: i highly suspect gpt

[2025-10-29 15:44] iris8721: ok but does anyone know why they regenerate everything on a qflash versus a regular flash for tpm

[2025-10-29 15:45] iris8721: since i asked a while back on uc but never got an answer

it certainly shouldn’t happen based on the spec, but vendors regularly fuck things up. dell, msi just breaking spec either from incompetence or laziness; dtpms like infineon, nuvoton have bugs via fw update pathway… ekpub should remain the same if eps is the same, but why follow spec when you can just reset everything and wipe your hands (dell).

[2025-10-29 16:22] iris8721: ic, thank you

from what i know msi has never had a good rap sheet of keeping up w their spec

[2025-10-29 19:54] plpg: what are "network splitters"? Hubs? Switches?

[2025-10-29 19:54] Brandon: X96dbg 😂😂😂

[2025-10-29 19:54] plpg: also lol @ DMA devices

[2025-10-29 19:54] plpg: sorry. your chipset gotta go

[2025-10-29 20:08] Brit: [replying to plpg: "what are "network splitters"? Hubs? Switches?"]
not sure since I have never played once human but a bit of technology in the past was to do pure packet level memery in games by just consuming the raw packets on a secondary pc and displaying a map / information about the game

[2025-10-29 20:08] Brit: hence "network splitter" which is a bit of a misnomer

[2025-10-29 20:09] plpg: ahh, that makes sense

[2025-10-29 20:09] Brit: ofcourse if sane encryption is used this is not real

[2025-10-29 20:09] Brit: but since game devs like self rolling everything

[2025-10-29 20:09] plpg: haha

He was also asking to resell from me too… 💀 🙏 he doesn’t know how to compile a program in release or “debuge” mode on his own so not surprised

[2025-10-31 01:40] daax: Alright fellas, we get it by now, let’s all move on from it to the relevant topics.

ik this is a pretty old post but do you have a ref on this? im pretty sure iommu is still enforced on internal devices

yeah i had an epic games bug bounty i got rewarded for which felt pretty cool

I have no official source for this but I'm pretty sure you're right
there is a default list of whitelisted device IDs though, which may be what he was thinking of
you can find it at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DmaSecurity\Default\AllowedBuses`

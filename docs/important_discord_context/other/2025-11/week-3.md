what happened

[2025-11-13 11:13] plpg: Anti cheats scan other open windows for banned strings in titles and/or memory

[2025-11-13 11:13] plpg: x64dbg is one of the strings. Its a very crude way of detecting you have some "shady" software running

[2025-11-13 13:02] plpg: [replying to Xyrem: "which ac?"]
I dont know which one, i heard that some of them do

[2025-11-13 13:02] plpg: I think roblox uses that

[2025-11-13 13:02] plpg: This was told to me by someone who had deliberately set his nickname to include "CheatEngine" <:kekw:904522300257345566>

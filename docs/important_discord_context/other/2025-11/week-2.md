[2025-11-05 19:46] BloodBerry: Is that safe to inject to EAC protected process?

[2025-11-05 19:47] BloodBerry: I mean using manual map cuz it seems like DLL is not detected by CE or Process Hacker…

<:BigBrain:702505954415083590>

[2025-11-05 20:49] pinefin: no, generally that is not safe to use for an EAC protected process solely based off CE & Sysinformer not seeing it...

[2025-11-05 21:10] Brit: did you know eac loads system informer to check for loaded modules

[2025-11-05 21:50] pinefin: <:nomore:927764940276772925> ran by a million dollar company btw

[2025-11-05 21:51] the horse: /s

[2025-11-05 22:11] Brit: [replying to pinefin: "is this a joke?"]
I thought that was obvious

[2025-11-05 22:11] pinefin: frick off

[2025-11-05 22:11] pinefin: it says gullible on the ceiling

[2025-11-05 22:20] pinefin: cheat-for-hire is not allowed in this server

[2025-11-05 22:22] Diro: ok

[2025-11-05 22:22] Diro: I'm sorry.

[2025-11-05 23:45] Matti: [replying to Diro: "I'm sorry."]
you can tell he learned his lesson because he changed to soliciting via DM instead

[2025-11-05 23:46] Matti: and of all the members, you decided to DM a moderator

[2025-11-05 23:46] Matti: banned for sheer stupidity

[2025-11-05 23:53] Bobby Hill: 😗

[2025-11-06 00:10] Matti: [replying to pinefin: "is this a joke?"]
he's trolling you but no it's not a joke, this is why more and more people are using system invader instead

[2025-11-06 00:11] Matti: personally I haven't looked back since switching

[2025-11-06 00:18] Matti: actually on the subject of loaded modules, when is MS going to realise the cpu in this system is not an intel

[2025-11-06 00:19] Matti: these keep coming back enabled after every windows update

we're WAYYYY past this topic but did you know something that is almost impossible thats the action of asking ai for something and then putting it into your own words?

Well yes but why would he talk about something that he does not know

to sound smart, boost ego, seem superior. theres a ton of reasons one would do this and they all sprout from insecurities

[2025-11-07 23:40] vanessa: Someone here posted a pretty long blog/article criticizing battleye, but looking for it in messages  i cant find it. Does anyone know the blog im talking about? it's not the reverse engineering one from secret club, its alot more recent - early 2025?

[2025-11-08 10:53] BloodBerry: [replying to vanessa: "Someone here posted a pretty long blog/article cri..."]
idk what you want as result…

[2025-11-08 16:07] Nudity: the blog…?

[2025-11-08 16:10] Nudity: [replying to vanessa: "Someone here posted a pretty long blog/article cri..."]
if you press the search button top right of your screen, search the whole discord for the word “battleye” and then click the links section, it should give you all battleye related blogs / links posted here.

The bottleye one ?

[2025-11-09 03:17] KR: Don't name a txt file `x64dbg` while running a protected game in the background, worst mistake of my life XD

[2025-11-09 11:47] plpg: A sufficiently advanced anti-cheat is indistinguishable from malware

Lol

[2025-11-09 13:19] Xits: [replying to KR: "Don't name a txt file `x64dbg` while running a pro..."]
Sounds like richochet

[2025-11-09 13:20] Xits: Pretty sure they banned for IDA in the past

[2025-11-09 17:37] WolverinDEV: does anyone know since when and based on which conditions faceit requires fTPM (firmware TPM) and does not accept dTPM (discrete TPM) chips any more?

where is this quote from

[2025-11-09 18:11] plpg: [replying to daax: "where is this quote from"]
it's a parody on Clarke's three laws that i came up with

[2025-11-09 18:11] the horse: sounds like a Low Level Engineering quote

[2025-11-09 18:13] plpg: it is very cheesy, i agree <:kekmusk:1124837680895774841>

[2025-11-09 18:13] plpg: and not exactly accurate

[2025-11-09 18:13] plpg: So it could be his quote <:kekw:904522300257345566>

[2025-11-09 18:43] Phillip (Code): Are there any good articles that describe how ACs detect network activity originating from usermode processes (aside from API hooking)? I've done some searching but can't find anything aside from EDRs and the like.

[2025-11-09 19:08] Addison: [replying to plpg: "A sufficiently advanced anti-cheat is indistinguis..."]
I prefer the variant, "A sufficiently Microsoft-developed software is indistinguishable from malware"

[2025-11-09 19:10] plpg: Given the state of recent antifeatures in windows it is true

[2025-11-09 20:18] mtu: [replying to Phillip (Code): "Are there any good articles that describe how ACs ..."]
The quote being discussed is super relevant. EDR is going to monitor network activity veeery similarly to how AC does it”

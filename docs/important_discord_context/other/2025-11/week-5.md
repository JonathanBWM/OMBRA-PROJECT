i think its solely stat based, but it does exist

[2025-11-24 15:42] pinefin: its a glorified stat checker that people are raving about

[2025-11-24 18:29] luci4: [replying to pinefin: "i think its solely stat based, but it does exist"]
Wdym?

[2025-11-24 18:29] luci4: Stats like headshot percentage, K/D ratio?

[2025-11-24 18:34] pinefin: yes

[2025-11-24 18:34] pinefin: and other metrics like bhops and whatnot

[2025-11-24 18:34] pinefin: people say if you look through walls at people a lot you’ll get banned

[2025-11-24 18:35] pinefin: i haven’t played cs in a long time so i cannot confirm

[2025-11-24 18:35] pinefin: i’ve definitely ran into a ton of cheaters in the past months i’ve played legit with irls

[2025-11-24 19:54] luci4: [replying to pinefin: "and other metrics like bhops and whatnot"]
Ah I see

[2025-11-24 19:54] luci4: Seems like it wont affect legit/closet cheaters that much, since they usually play with low FOV aimbot and high smoothing

[2025-11-24 19:54] luci4: And considering they gutted Overwatch, they're probably banking on trust factor

[2025-11-24 20:06] pinefin: i hear trust factor thrown around a lot, i assume im low on trust factor by the sheer amount of cheaters i encountered

[2025-11-24 21:21] luci4: This is a really interesting read

[2025-11-24 21:46] iris8721: it seems overwatch (the game) has turned up their account closure system a lot

[2025-11-24 21:46] iris8721: its really aggresive from what ive seen now compared to a few years ago

[2025-11-24 23:26] TRUCK: a friend of mine (totally not me) has an upcoming interview for an anti-cheat engineering position at a game company.  anyone have advice/resources/info or could possibly offer a reference (if you know them)?

[2025-11-24 23:26] koyz: advice: if it's Ubisoft, run.

[2025-11-24 23:27] TRUCK: [replying to koyz: "advice: if it's Ubisoft, run."]
good advice so far right there haha

[2025-11-24 23:28] koyz: Seriously though, I suppose "the friend of yours" applied for the position because they are already knowledgeable in the field, or hopefully so in some way or another
if not, some short term advices, blog posts, etc. won't really help imho

[2025-11-24 23:30] TRUCK: [replying to koyz: "Seriously though, I suppose "the friend of yours" ..."]
yup, but it's their first time getting an interview in the field

[2025-11-24 23:31] koyz: if it's a larger company glassdoor might have some information about the interviews conducted for the role, or similar ones

[2025-11-24 23:31] TRUCK: [replying to koyz: "if it's a larger company glassdoor might have some..."]
ah nice idea thank you

don't be an idiot (pretty hard to be since you have experience). give real practical examples, think through the challenge questions they throw at you and ask clarifying questions, they will almost always ask you questions to problems they have to solve or have already solved. use your experience to rationalize and walk them through your thought process.

[2025-11-24 23:41] daax: if you applied for an ac role and have done any sort of game hacking, re/vr work, and larger software engineering projects you're probably gonna be fine

[2025-11-26 08:28] jenrix: [replying to daax: "if you applied for an ac role and have done any so..."]
I'm sorry I'm curious but what "vr" mean?

[2025-11-26 08:39] koyz: [replying to jenrix: "I'm sorry I'm curious but what "vr" mean?"]
Vulnerability research iirc

[2025-11-26 08:42] jenrix: [replying to koyz: "Vulnerability research iirc"]
Oh make sense thanks

[2025-11-26 13:35] daax: [replying to jenrix: "I'm sorry I'm curious but what "vr" mean?"]
ye, vulnerability research

[2025-11-28 21:26] noahsx: [replying to koyz: "advice: if it's Ubisoft, run."]
whats wrong with Ubisoft?

[2025-11-28 21:27] koyz: [replying to noahsx: "whats wrong with Ubisoft?"]
everything, from work culture to management

[2025-11-28 21:28] noahsx: oh i hadnt heard about that

[2025-11-28 21:28] noahsx: thanks for the fast reply btw

[2025-11-28 21:29] koyz: [replying to noahsx: "thanks for the fast reply btw"]
I am chronically online <:Kek:1414590414123696308>

[2025-11-28 22:14] Mikewind22: [replying to noahsx: "whats wrong with Ubisoft?"]
Yes

[2025-11-29 13:54] the horse: [replying to noahsx: "whats wrong with Ubisoft?"]
AFAIK they have an extremely poor managerial structure and bad working conditions

[2025-11-29 13:55] the horse: to my knowledge, they're pretty old-school when it comes to programmer acquisition and jewing out on it heavily

[2025-11-29 13:56] the horse: you can have a portfolio demonstrating a vast, deep skillset and be put somewhere along the lines of a junior or not-so-important because you don't have a degree, or professional experience

[2025-11-29 14:12] noahsx: ohh i see

[2025-11-29 14:12] noahsx: thank you for clarifying

[2025-11-29 14:12] noahsx: have a great day

[2025-11-30 17:06] Jacob: Anyone have a recommendation for a microcontroller I could use to emulate mouse inputs?

[2025-11-30 17:08] the horse: arduino?

[2025-11-30 17:08] Jacob: Was thinking about a arduino or teensy

[2025-11-30 17:12] Gestalt: [replying to Jacob: "Was thinking about a arduino or teensy"]
Go use an esp32-s3 please

[2025-11-30 17:12] Gestalt: Arduinos are dog shit

[2025-11-30 17:27] plpg: yeah, esp32 is a good chocie. You get a working setup out of the box with all the goodies of a real RTOS (freeRTOS)

[2025-11-30 17:28] plpg: That, or if you like playing with hardware then get any arduino board, and dont use arduino libraries but program in bare metal (cmsis or libopencm3 for ARM based stuff)

[2025-11-30 17:28] plpg: [replying to plpg: "yeah, esp32 is a good chocie. You get a working se..."]
(that includes real, preemptive multitasking, IPC, mutexes and anything else you can dream of)

[2025-11-30 17:41] Gestalt: [replying to plpg: "yeah, esp32 is a good chocie. You get a working se..."]
Just plz make sure its an esp32-s3 and not the OG esp32

[2025-11-30 17:42] plpg: true

[2025-11-30 17:44] Gestalt: If you need any help Jacob just let me know

[2025-11-30 17:44] Gestalt: And also STAY AWAY from arduino ide and arduino cores

[2025-11-30 17:44] Gestalt: use esp idf

[2025-11-30 17:44] iris8721: [replying to Jacob: "Anyone have a recommendation for a microcontroller..."]
are you looking for something that already gets around anticheats or not

[2025-11-30 17:46] 0xdeluks: [replying to Gestalt: "And also STAY AWAY from arduino ide and arduino co..."]
why is that lol

[2025-11-30 17:46] Gestalt: [replying to 0xdeluks: "why is that lol"]
the cores are horribly written

[2025-11-30 17:46] Gestalt: the code is just bad

[2025-11-30 17:46] Gestalt: most arduino libraries are just bloated

[2025-11-30 17:46] Gestalt: and just take away flash

[2025-11-30 17:46] Gestalt: everything is written in c++

[2025-11-30 17:46] 0xdeluks: I see

[2025-11-30 17:46] Gestalt: you just kill performance with that

[2025-11-30 17:47] Gestalt: (VTables and so on)

[2025-11-30 17:48] Gestalt: [replying to 0xdeluks: "I see"]
A good example is this piece of shit, https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2

[2025-11-30 17:48] Gestalt: It literally uses your entire flash

[2025-11-30 17:48] Gestalt: because it uses templates everywhere

[2025-11-30 17:49] Gestalt: Also most usb libraries that exist for arduino are terrible

[2025-11-30 18:17] plpg: Even the original basic arduino library for AVR was so idiotically bloated

[2025-11-30 18:17] plpg: I remember we were having fun about it because it took 300+ cycles to set a pin value

[2025-11-30 18:18] plpg: Which is done in one cycle on an AVR

[2025-11-30 18:18] plpg: Normally. From compiled C code

[2025-11-30 18:18] plpg: It is so bloated and slow

[2025-11-30 18:33] Jacob: [replying to Gestalt: "Just plz make sure its an esp32-s3 and not the OG ..."]
Doing some research would something like this be good?

Holy shit YEah I agree with you

[2025-11-30 18:43] Gestalt: I cant even fathom how they continued to use AVR chips

[2025-11-30 18:44] plpg: [replying to Jacob: "https://www.adafruit.com/product/5364?srsltid=AfmB..."]
This one looks ok i think

[2025-11-30 18:44] Gestalt: look at this shit

[2025-11-30 18:44] Gestalt: this is only c

[2025-11-30 18:44] plpg: Make sure that one USB is connected to the esp and not to a UART chip

[2025-11-30 18:44] Gestalt: Now imagine what c++ and vtables would do to the poor little avr microcontroller

[2025-11-30 18:45] plpg: Well yeah but these are two u64's

[2025-11-30 18:45] plpg: this is an 8 bit micro

[2025-11-30 18:45] Gestalt: Yeha

[2025-11-30 18:45] Gestalt: Yeah

[2025-11-30 18:45] Gestalt: its dog shit

[2025-11-30 18:45] Gestalt: yet arduino continued to sell 8-bit (16 bit) avr based boards

Yeah, you can buy it off aliexpress, https://aliexpress.com/item/1005009906920237.html

[2025-11-30 18:47] plpg: honestly AVR itself is not that bad when it comes to 8 bit micros. Its the best 8 bit micro IMO. just dont use it for stuff that needs more than 8 bits

[2025-11-30 18:47] Gestalt: [replying to plpg: "honestly AVR itself is not that bad when it comes ..."]
Yeah I agree

[2025-11-30 18:47] plpg: i used it a lot for simple doodads, but i use stm32 now

[2025-11-30 18:47] Gestalt: ah, I don't like stm32 chips

[2025-11-30 18:47] Gestalt: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[2025-11-30 18:47] Gestalt: I don't like cube ide

[2025-11-30 18:48] Gestalt: and so on

[2025-11-30 18:48] Gestalt: but tbh stm32's are very capable

[2025-11-30 18:50] plpg: I dont like cube ide and STs idiotic HAL either. I just use CMSIS directly or libopencm3

just program your own

[2025-11-30 19:20] Gestalt: its not that hard tbfh

[2025-11-30 19:20] iris8721: a lot cheaper too probably, think ferrum is quite pricey iirc

[2025-11-30 19:21] Gestalt: might as well learn a bit more about usb

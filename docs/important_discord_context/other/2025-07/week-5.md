Tastes a bit like a weak green tea

They’re probably estimating based on the handful of public sites they mentioned and active subs for those. It’s definitely higher than that.

*scam market

[2025-07-29 08:58] Oliver: 90% of cheats are just pasts from a good github project

[2025-07-29 09:00] the horse: a lot of those projects were previously up for sale as well

i mean sure, but look for example valorant  cheat market

[2025-07-29 09:02] Oliver: that has turned into a criminal trap house

are cheat devs defeating vanguard?
i never played valorant but my friends that do say that before it was 1 cheater in 500 games, now its 1 in 30 at best. I dont know how they got that info just that valorant has a lot of cheaters.
Are cheat devs just focusing on dma for this game?

[2025-07-29 09:06] Horsie: Arent all anticheats moot now that smm based primitives are available?

[2025-07-29 09:06] Horsie: or is it not as widespread yet

ist the same there, the ones being sold are pasts

[2025-07-29 09:07] Horsie: At that point i think its a matter of providing better features to the user than mitigating the AC

[2025-07-29 09:07] Horsie: Unless of course you're trying to fix detection of the usermode component

not in a p2c perspective

[2025-07-29 09:09] Horsie: yeah fair.

[2025-07-29 09:09] Oliver: pretty hard to install

[2025-07-29 09:09] Horsie: as an individual its a pretty good thing

[2025-07-29 09:09] Horsie: I loved using it.

[2025-07-29 09:09] Oliver: ye, i had my smm driver a year or so ago

[2025-07-29 09:09] Oliver: published it on github a while back

[2025-07-29 09:09] Horsie: Im glad to say i was on smm before it was cool haha

[2025-07-29 09:09] Horsie: let me chrck my first commit date

[2025-07-29 09:10] Horsie: 22 Jan 2023

[2025-07-29 09:10] Oliver: my was back in 2022

[2025-07-29 09:11] Horsie: 😁

[2025-07-29 09:11] Oliver: i wonder when someone will start doing something original again

[2025-07-29 09:11] Oliver: like spoofing the bios images etc

[2025-07-29 09:45] Brit: Tragic

[2025-07-29 09:45] Horsie: Looking for lga1151 cheatboard (ddr6) {at least 4 m.2 slots} [onboard wifi needed]

[2025-07-29 09:45] Xyrem: I know lmao

[2025-07-29 09:46] Horsie: [replying to Brit: "The lengths regards will go to cheat in videogames..."]
security through obscurity just keeps on winning

[2025-07-29 09:46] Xyrem: do you know some people sell "methods" to block/fail VT-D by blocking some pins on the cpu

[2025-07-29 09:46] Brit: To be fair that is based

[2025-07-29 09:47] Xyrem: chinese cheaters are really something else

that would be wicked. ill check out if thats possible lmao. I have some pdfs with pin layouts on amd

[2025-07-29 09:47] Brit: Masking off pins to make your new cpu compatible with older boards was such a vibe

would you mijd discussing this in about an hour or so

[2025-07-29 09:49] Horsie: once my commute ends and i pull uo some pdfs

[2025-07-29 09:49] Xyrem: I dont actually know much about the topic, I just heard about it

[2025-07-29 09:49] Horsie: this would make a cool meme project

[2025-07-29 09:50] Horsie: though utterly useless for me since i dont have any dma devices

[2025-07-29 09:51] Xyrem: not even sure if its actually real, but apparently the reviews for it on some website were quite a few. So if they arent fake, then I suppose it is real

[2025-07-29 09:52] Horsie: I couldn't care less about cheating itself

[2025-07-29 09:52] Horsie: but im super glad that its driven so many people into program optimization/deobf

[2025-07-29 09:52] Horsie: Even those I suck, I have grewt love for the topic

ye, people pay 600-800 dollars for a dma card

[2025-07-29 10:10] Oliver: paying 200 dollars for a mobo isnt that much

[2025-07-29 10:10] Oliver: just gotta coat the product with terms like "undetectable", "ring -2"

[2025-07-29 12:00] mtu: I’m mildly surprised that there’s not been any “supply chain” hacks of cheat providers - I’m going to bet that most p2c customers have both access to moderate amounts of money and lack the critical thought to not log into other stuff on the box they paid someone to bypass security controls on

the vast majority of p2c customers have 50 bucks on their paypal

[2025-07-29 13:41] brymko: and what you are describing happens all the time

[2025-07-29 13:45] mtu: I know p2c devs have done hijinks on their customers, I'm talking about Solarwinds-style "ArtificialAim dev compromised, it's now distributing malware"

anything more than a basic hypervisor is unnecessary for solo. I'd say even a hypervisor is overkill if you just want to cheat individually, depending on the anti-cheat. the result of lack of a brain is overengineering.

[2025-07-29 14:12] Horsie: [replying to daax: "anything more than a basic hypervisor is unnecessa..."]
You think so? I've been under the impression that hypervisors would be much harder to do properly.

[2025-07-29 14:12] daax: [replying to Horsie: "You think so? I've been under the impression that ..."]
I know so.

[2025-07-29 14:12] Horsie: I used smm for a bit due to hoe easy it was to write

[2025-07-29 14:12] daax: And yes, they're difficult to do properly because people don't think or rtfm.

[2025-07-29 14:12] Horsie: I guess people just dont do it because it risks blowing your rom

[2025-07-29 14:14] iPower: [replying to Horsie: "You think so? I've been under the impression that ..."]
a hypervisor is really only useful for reverse engineering an anti-cheat itself. for cheating it's definitely not needed

I've always been intimidated by the virtualization-obfuscated ACs.  Its particularly my mental state. Thought its safer to run at a higher privilege than play thr constant cat and mouse game

[2025-07-29 14:17] iPower: i rarely even load my hypervisor nowadays. only when im interested in tracing some anti-cheat module

you should give it a go, you can get a pretty solid grasp of what virtualized ACs are doing with the right tools; and/or deobfuscate small segments of them once you have a base understanding

Ah. I mostly only ever tried poking eac and vgk. both worked wonderfully with smm. Never really had the balls to run gakes under my prod machine (laptop)

1) Why poke at the AC that only protects anime cs? Game is trash <:Kappa:794707301436358686> 
2) EAC is not for beginners lol

[2025-07-29 14:20] the horse: I'd recommend adhesive (fivem)

you won't statically analyze shit
but dynamic analysis does wonders

[2025-07-29 14:20] the horse: and it gives a good introduction into bypassing integrity checks & inferring detection methods from syscall logs

[2025-07-29 14:20] Horsie: [replying to daax: "1) Why poke at the AC that only protects anime cs?..."]
The plqn was- as silly as it may sound; to implement a slightly stealthier voyager. So basically patch the hv module from smm. than to have a comically large boot hook chain

icebp on all of them go brrr (do not tell them that locking their central mutex locks up the integrity and half the detections :((( )

[2025-07-29 14:21] daax: FairFight and PunkBuster are older ACs but they still did their job. You'll have some fun coming up with anti-screenshot methods and so on with Battlefield 4 for example. Good for learning the ropes imo, or VAC.

[2025-07-29 14:22] iPower: acs that take screenshots are the funniest ones IMO

A lot of p2c copy/pasters and customers assume running at a higher level priv is safer, but it just allows stealthier techniques that you need to leverage also. It’s not a golden bullet

[2025-07-29 14:31] Timmy: but why are we 'spacing' before a call?

[2025-07-29 14:31] the horse: i like it.

[2025-07-29 14:32] Timmy: something I'd have to get used to for sure LOL

[2025-07-29 14:32] the horse: if I had to write the spaces myself i wouldn't give a shit about it

[2025-07-29 14:32] koyz: weirdly enough, spaces before a call is a bit much imho, however in all other cases I really like to have spaces everywhere <:Kek:752643961851609139> makes stuff just more readable

[2025-07-29 14:32] iPower: using spaces before calls is too much for me

[2025-07-29 14:32] the horse: thankfully .editorconfig forces my code style on all people that pull 😎

[2025-07-29 14:33] Timmy: I personally don't care much about formatting rules, I merely want it to be consistent and readable

[2025-07-29 14:33] Timmy: I get a clang-format file and change it when something isn't readable to me, otherwise I don't think about it LOL

[2025-07-29 14:33] Brit: As more time passes I become more and more radicalised about formatting issues

ah yeah thats fine but i do know people that prefer using notepad till this day (dont ask me why)

like with hypervisors? mmh not really *for the basics, just time consuming

[2025-07-29 14:47] the horse: you are the host, you have another guest hv under you and then there's the OS

[2025-07-29 14:48] Timmy: that'll be terrible

[2025-07-29 14:48] Timmy: big impl

[2025-07-29 14:49] the horse: I guess if you don't intend to fully isolate it might not be *as* painful, you'd need to maintain the guest vmcs and such, but maybe you could shim off some time if you pass some less relevant things directly to host and have the events handled by the guest hv

well, it's a much smaller task and something that's naturally supported as long as all the other required OS facilities are already emulated

[2025-07-29 14:51] the horse: I can't imagine it's as straightforward

[2025-07-29 14:52] UJ: its pretty easy to do passthrough nested virtualization on amd since their vmcs (vmcb) is described with a memory region as opposed to intel vmx.

[2025-07-29 14:52] the horse: yeah, like all this data being properly virtualized and injected is what's kind of boggling my head

[2025-07-29 14:53] the horse: well, serializing it, providing the vmcs (or vmcb) interface

[2025-07-29 14:53] the horse: [replying to UJ: "its pretty easy to do passthrough nested virtualiz..."]
so you can just copy the entire structure?

[2025-07-29 14:54] the horse: I'd like to use the benefits of having hyper-v loaded while also not reversing half the thing to make it do what I want, and unfuck some things that are problematic for transparency

consider having the handle the nested cases for sgx <:Kappa:794707301436358686>

you're writing a hypervisor for what? I thought your emulator was strictly usermode

not copy, but the L1 HV can setup its own VMCB and "launch" and it should work without any official handling in the L0 HV.

They run gcp, which used sgx/tdx, so they did a security review on it for that reason probably. If those vulnerabilities came out from malicious actors and was used on gcp, it’d hurt them a lot.

[2025-07-29 15:20] 0xatul: Oh wow totally forgot to consider that thanks

They have an incentive bc of confidential computing

[2025-07-30 05:06] Mitch: all of the main cloud providers are moving towards it

[2025-07-30 05:07] Mitch: TDX, SEV-SNP, etc, provide this

[2025-07-30 05:07] Mitch: So it's in their best interest to do red team fun on TDX/SEV-SNP

[2025-07-30 05:08] Mitch: Oh people answered the exact same above me and I'm blind my bad

[2025-07-30 05:08] Mitch: [replying to mtu: "Google’s also done stuff in AMD SEV and ARM CCA/tr..."]
Absolutely. TDX and SEV SNP at the current front runners.

[2025-07-30 05:08] Mitch: SGX is deprecated and being phased out for tdx

[2025-07-30 05:10] Mitch: Expect this feature to become more common over time, albeit, the way GCP and AWS and Azure approach it are all different.

[2025-07-30 05:10] Mitch: So while each one may use the TEE, the actual specifics differ greatly

[2025-07-30 05:10] Mitch: For example, using a paravisor vs hypervisor for elightened guests

[2025-07-30 05:11] Mitch: or to keep the guest unelightened

[2025-07-30 05:11] Mitch: support for DMA exceptions because network cards may need this

[2025-07-30 05:11] Mitch: If you have any questions about this stuff I will be able to answer, this is my job actually

[2025-07-30 05:11] Mitch: lol

[2025-07-30 05:12] Mitch: I think it's neat

[2025-07-30 10:18] mtu: Any idea when non-compute hardware will support virtualized domains a la AWS Nitro Storage/Network? I know it’s being worked on for basically the same reasons - confidential computing doesn’t extend to the storage/network layer, and that’s sad )’’:

[2025-07-31 08:35] Mitch: [replying to mtu: "Any idea when non-compute hardware will support vi..."]
Actually, that depends on the provider!

I can't speak for GCP or AWS, but azure *does* have work in that direction at the bare minimum

[2025-07-31 08:36] Mitch: It's challenging in particular when it comes to confidential VMs for networking due to the passthrough requirements

[2025-07-31 08:37] Mitch: As the guest has to be explicitly enlightened to the existence of the passthrough and DMA has to be allowed via in-guest (since they have the key, not the hypervisor)

[2025-07-31 08:38] Mitch: You did ask "when", and that I'm unsure. Both for "am I allowed to say?" reasons but also there have been issues in development

[2025-07-31 08:39] Mitch: Specifically bc this kinda stuff involves cross-company collab rather than cross team

[2025-07-31 08:40] Mitch: meetings with Intel/AMD/etc take awhile to setup and execute if any blockers happen

[2025-07-31 08:40] Mitch: It id say you can expect that at least within 2 years or less.

[2025-07-31 08:40] Mitch: If it's not out by 2026 something has gone wrong lol

[2025-07-31 11:18] mtu: That’s cool! Yeah I definitely meant on hardware that normies can buy, so it’s good to hear that vendor collab is happening instead of the AWS Annapurna strategy

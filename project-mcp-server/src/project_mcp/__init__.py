OMBRA Project Management MCP Server

The external brain for agent intelligence. Provides:
- File and function indexing
- Feature-to-file linkage
- Stub detection
- Task management
- Impact analysis
- Codebase health metrics

This MCP server exists so the agent stops:
- Scanning the codebase 19 times per hour
- Hallucinating what's implemented
- Stubbing code and claiming it's done
- Wasting tokens on exploration
